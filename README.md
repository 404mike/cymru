The idea of this repository is to have a collection of data for all towns and villages in Wales for free. It's hoped that people will contribute to this project to help correct data and to give suggestions on what other information can be added.

Progress
--------
I have gathered data from a couple of websites, the location data comes from Google Maps and the Wikipedia links comes from the Wikipedia API. The data in its current form is far from accurate, I'm going to have to go through the data manually to check and correct data.
