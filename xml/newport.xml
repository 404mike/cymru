            <wikipedia lang="en" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allt-yr-yn">Allt-yr-yn (Welsh: Allt-yr-ynn) is a suburb of the city of Newport, south-east Wales.
Pronounced by English-speaking locals as "Olt-er-reen", the spelling should include two Ns at the end, as "Allt-yr-ynn". The name means "The slope (allt) of the ash trees (ynn which is the plural of onnen - ash tree)" in Welsh.
Allt-yr-yn forms an electoral ward (district) and coterminous community parish of the city. It is mainly residential and contains many large houses built in the early part of the 20th century. Some of the district is built upon the Ridgeway, with some of the ward offering views of surrounding areas such as Twmbarlwm. The area is governed by the Newport City Council.

Towards the City Centre, Allt-yr-yn is home to the offices of Newport City Council, at the Civic Centre, of which its clock tower can be seen for miles around.
University of Wales, Newport had a campus located in Allt-yr-yn. It served as the university's Science, IT and Business faculty. before moving to a site with a new &#xA3;35 million complex on the banks of the River Usk in central Newport. The new campus formally opened in January 2011. Initially the new campus will house the Newport Business School and design, film and media elements of the Newport School of Art, Media and Design.
On the west side of Allt-yr-yn heights there is a Local Nature Reserve containing ancient woodland, meadows and five ponds. Between 1934 and the mid-1960s this was home to an open-air swimming baths, and is now managed by a volunteer group known as WING - Wildlife in Newport Group. The nature reserve borders the Crumlin Arm of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal which runs parallel to the M4 Motorway at Allt-yr-yn. Lock 2 has been restored by volunteers and work has started on lock 3. Lock 1 disappeared under road works in Newport early in the 20th century.
A permanent military presence was established in the area with the completion of the Cavalry Barracks in 1845.
There was once a hospital in the ward, but this was deemed surplus to requirements and the site is now the Allt-yr-yn Heights estate.</wikipedia>

It is roughly bounded by Duckpool Road, Church Road and Caerleon Road. It lies within the electoral ward of Saint Julian's and to the west is Riverside.
The original houses in the area were very slum-like tight rows with people living in appalling conditions. A local religious man Edward Barnard invested into building small new terraces. A condition of building the "new village" was that there were to be no pubs in the area and the names of the streets are that of church figures, e.g. Morden Road, Canon Street, Bishop Street, &amp;c.</wikipedia>

The name is said to derive from "Bishop's Town", as the village has been alleged to the sometime home of the Bishops of Llandaff. Owain Glyndwr destroyed the palaces at Bishton and Llandaff, from which time the episcopal palace was moved to Mathern.

It lies one third of the way down the South Island's east coast, just north of Banks Peninsula, which itself, since 2006, lies within the formal limits of Christchurch. The population of Christchurch City at the 5 March 2013 census was 341,469.
The city was named by the Canterbury Association, which settled the surrounding province of Canterbury. The name of Christchurch was agreed on at the first meeting of the association on 27 March 1848. It was suggested by John Robert Godley, who had attended Christ Church, Oxford. Some early writers called the town Christ Church, but it was recorded as Christchurch in the minutes of the management committee of the association. Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand.
The river that flows through the centre of the city (its banks now largely forming an urban park) was named Avon at the request of the pioneering Deans brothers to commemorate the Scottish Avon, which rises in the Ayrshire hills near what was their grandfathers' farm and flows into the Clyde.
The usual M&#x101;ori name for Christchurch is &#x14C;tautahi ("the place of Tautahi"). This was originally the name of a specific site by the Avon River near present-day Kilmore Street and the Christchurch Central Fire Station. The site was a seasonal dwelling of Ng&#x101;i Tahu chief Te Potiki Tautahi, whose main home was Port Levy on Banks Peninsula. The &#x14C;tautahi name was adopted in the 1930s. Prior to that the Ng&#x101;i Tahu generally referred to the Christchurch area as Karaitiana, a transliteration of the English word Christian. The city's name is often abbreviated by New Zealanders to Chch. In New Zealand Sign Language, the city's name is the fingerspelled letter C (made by forming the hand into a C shape) signed twice, with the second to the right of the first, while mouthing "Christchurch".</wikipedia>

The parish is bounded by Percoed reen to the south, Nant-y-Selsig to the southwest, and Pound Hill to the west. The northern boundary is formed from Gwern-y-cleppa to junction 28 of the M4, then the A48 Cardiff Road. The eastern boundary is formed from the Ebbw River Bridge roundabout to the west of the International Rectifier plant, Duffryn Drive, along the southern edge of Tredegar House country park, Pencarn Lane and Percoed Lane.
Despite being a mostly rural parish to the south and west, the north and east is a continuation of the Duffryn built-up area, and has seen large increases in population in recent years due to the continued suburbanisation of Newport. This built-up area of Coedkernew forms a crescent around Duffryn and as such, much newly built housing in the Duffryn area actually falls within Coedkernew.
This area contains the landmark Coedkernew footbridge over the A48, the giant LG plant, three business parks or industrial parks: Imperial Park, Celtic Springs and Cleppa Park, the Patent Office, Office for National Statistics, Tredegar House as well as the large Celtic Horizons estate and St. Josephs RC High School.
At the northern boundary near Gwern-y-cleppa, the remains of a pre-historic burial chamber can be found which is believed to be neolithic. It is also considered to be one of the possible sites for Celliwig, the earliest recorded localisation for King Arthur's court.

Crindau is roughly bounded by the Monmouthshire canal to the west, the M4 motorway to the north, River Usk to the east and South Wales Main Line to the south. It is bisected by the elevated section of the A4042 road. The district is well-served in transport terms as it contains junction 26 and 25a of the M4 as well as the A4042 and A4051 roads. There is a regular Newport Transport bus service from Malpas and Bettws to the city centre.
To the eastern side, adjoining the river is Shaftesbury Park, which was the original home of Newport Rugby Club before they moved to the Newport Athletics and Cricket Club site at Rodney Parade.
A cycle and pedestrian walkway alongside the River Usk links Newport city centre at Crindau to the Home Farm area of Caerleon, 1 mile from central Caerleon. It is planned to extend the walkway from Home Farm to the centre of Caerleon. There is a marked heritage trail in Caerleon.
Crindau is well served by a number of churches providing a cross-section of Christian traditions including Malpas Road Evangelical Church, Crindau Christian Fellowship, Shaftesbury Methodist Church and All Saints Church.</wikipedia>

            <wikipedia lang="en" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffryn">Duffryn (Welsh: Dyffryn) is a large housing estate [1] in the southwest of the city of Newport, south Wales comprising a large portion of the Tredegar Park electoral district (ward). Built on land belonging to Tredegar House [2], it was completed in 1978 and at the time won several awards for its design. The layout of the estate, as viewed from above, is that of large terraces undulating around a central wooded area. Originally a Council Estate, Duffryn is now a mix of private ownership and Newport City Homes RSL (Registered Social Landlord) properties.
The design of the estate is the result of a council competition. It was won by a consortium committed to the theories of planning devised in the architecture department of Cambridge University in the 1960s. The District Amenities Centre that was planned for the south-west corner of the 96-acre site was never built, so the plan of a largely self-sufficient community was not realised.
Despite the relative recent development of the estate, the name Duffryn is an ancient name for the area. Duffryn is an anglicised version of the Welsh Dyffryn (meaning large U-shaped valley).
Duffryn is home to two of Newport's largest secondary schools &#x2014; Duffryn High School [3] and St. Joseph's RC High School. In 2006, Duffryn High School was the filming location of the Doctor Who episode "School Reunion", filmed in late-summer 2005.
The majority of the estate is heated from an updated central boiler house.</wikipedia>

Maindee is home to a sizeable Asian-Muslim population with three mosques located in the area.
A large selection of shops are located on Chepstow Road, Corporation Road and Church Road. A station of Gwent Police and a public library are located on Chepstow Road. A station of South Wales Fire and Rescue Service is also located in Maindee.
The annual Maindee Festival and Parade, held each Summer, is a popular community arts event to all residents in Newport.
The former Maindee Baths is an Art Deco building and the disused empty swimming pool has been used for location shots in the BBC TV series Being Human.
Maindee Unlimited, a community-led regeneration charity for the Maindee area, was formed in 2014.

            <wikipedia lang="en" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal">The Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal is a small network of canals in South Wales. For most of its 35-mile (56 km) length it runs through the Brecon Beacons National Park, and its present rural character and tranquillity belies its original purpose as an industrial corridor for coal and iron, which were brought to the canal by a network of tramways and/or railroads, many of which were built and owned by the canal company.
The "Mon and Brec" was originally two independent canals - the Monmouthshire Canal from Newport to Pontymoile Basin (including the Crumlin Arm) and the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal running from Pontymoile to Brecon. Both canals were abandoned in 1962, but the Brecknock and Abergavenny route and a small section of the Monmouthshire route have been reopened since 1970. Much of the rest of the original Monmouthshire Canal is the subject of a restoration plan, which includes the construction of a new marina at the Newport end of the canal.</wikipedia>

            <wikipedia lang="en" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhiwderin">Rhiwderin (Welsh: Rhiwderyn) is a small village in the west of the city of Newport, South Wales.
It lies in the community parish and electoral district (ward) of Graig.
The original village lies across a level crossing alongside the Ebbw Valley Railway and off the main A468 Newport&#x2014;Caerphilly road. There are additional houses on the other side of the main road known as Rhiwderin Heights which have almost merged the village with neighbouring Bassaleg.
The Pentrepoeth School is the local primary school in the area.

            <wikipedia lang="en" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerton">Somerton /&#x2C8;s&#x28C;m&#x259;rt&#x259;n/ is a small town and civil parish in the South Somerset district of the English county of Somerset. It gave its name to the county of Somerset, was briefly, around the start of the 14th century, the county town, and around 900 AD was possibly the capital of Wessex. It has held a weekly market since the Middle Ages, and the main square with its market cross is today an attractive location for visitors. Situated on the River Cary, approximately 8.8 miles (14.2 km) north-west of Yeovil, the town has its own parish council serving a population of 4,697 as of 2011. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Etsome and Hurcot.
The history of Somerton dates back to the Anglo-Saxon era, when it was an important political and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined despite being the former county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century. Despite losing county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later rail transport via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining.
In the centre of Somerton the wide market square, with its octagonal roofed market cross, is surrounded by old houses, while close by is the 13th century Church of St Michael and All Angels. Somerton also had links with Muchelney Abbey in the Middle Ages. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.</wikipedia>
