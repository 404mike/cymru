Botany Bay has its source in the confluence of the Georges River at Taren Point and the Cooks River at Kyeemagh and flows 10 km (6 mi) to the east before meeting its mouth, the Tasman Sea, midpoint between La Perouse and Kurnell.\nThe total catchment area of the bay is approximately 55 km2 (21 sq mi) and the area surrounding the bay is generally managed by Roads and Maritime Services. Despite its relative shallowness, the bay serves as greater metropolitan Sydney's main cargo seaport, located at Port Botany, with facilities managed by Sydney Ports Corporation. Two runways of Sydney Airport extend into the bay. Botany Bay National Park is located on the northern and southern headlands of the bay.\nThe land adjacent to Botany Bay was occupied for many thousands of years by the Tharawal and Eora Aboriginal peoples and their associated clans. On 29 April 1770, Botany Bay was the site of James Cook's first landing of HMS Endeavour on the continent of Australia, after his extensive navigation of New Zealand. Later the British planned Botany Bay as the site for a penal colony. Out of these plans came the first European habitation of Australia at Sydney Cove. Even though the penal settlement was almost immediately shifted to Sydney Cove, for some time in Britain transportation to \"Botany Bay\" was a metonym for transportation to any of the Australian penal settlements."

It is located on the River Wye, about 2 miles (3.2 km) above its confluence with the River Severn, and adjoining the western end of the Severn Bridge. It is 16 miles (26 km) east of Newport, 18 miles (29 km) north-west of Bristol and 110 miles (180 km) west of London.\nChepstow Castle, situated on a clifftop above the Wye and its bridge, is often cited as the oldest surviving stone castle in Britain. The castle was established by William FitzOsbern immediately after the Norman conquest, and was extended in later centuries before becoming ruined after the Civil War. A Benedictine priory was also established within the walled town, which was the centre of the Marcher lordship of Striguil. The port of Chepstow became noted in the Middle Ages for its imports of wine, and also became a major centre for the export of timber and bark, from nearby woodland in the Wye valley and Forest of Dean. In the late eighteenth century the town was a focus of early tourism as part of the \"Wye Tour\", and the tourist industry remains important. Other important industries included shipbuilding \u2013 one of the First World War National Shipyards was established in the town \u2013 and heavy engineering, including the prefabrication of bridges and, now, wind turbine towers. Chepstow is also well known for its racecourse, which has hosted the Welsh National each year since 1949.\nThe town had a population of 10,821 according to the 2001 census, increasing to 12,350 at the 2011 census. It is served by the M48 motorway, and its accessibility to the cities of Bristol, Newport and Cardiff means it has a large number of commuters. It is administered as part of Monmouthshire County Council, and is within the Monmouth parliamentary constituency and Wales Assembly constituency. Chepstow is on the western bank of the Wye, while adjoining villages on the eastern bank of the river, Tutshill and Sedbury, are located in England."

Maryland was the seventh state to ratify the United States Constitution, and has three occasionally used nicknames: the Old Line State, the Free State, and the Chesapeake Bay State.\nMaryland is also considered to be the birthplace of religious freedom in America, dating back to its earliest colonial days when it was made a refuge for persecuted Catholics from England by George Calvert the first Lord Baltimore, and the first English proprietor of the then-Maryland colonial grant.\nMaryland is one of the smallest states in terms of area, as well as one of the most densely populated states of the United States. Maryland has the highest median household income, making it the wealthiest state in the USA. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis.\nAlthough the state is officially claimed to be named after Queen Henrietta Maria, some Catholics believe Maryland was named after Mary, the mother of Jesus, by George Calvert, 1st Lord Baltimore prior to his death in 1632. The original intent may never be known. There is a St. Mary's County in Maryland."

It has been a recorded practice in many parts of Europe throughout the Medieval and Early Modern periods, although became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. Today, the tradition is still observed in some parts of Europe and among European communities in North America."

It has a tiny parish church dedicated to St. Andoenus, which was almost wholly rebuilt in 1880 and which lies in the Parish of Mathern and Mounton with St Pierre.\nSt. Andoenus has been identified by some with St. Owen, and by others as an obscure Greek saint. It has been suggested that he was initially a 7th-century French scribe, but became Bishop of Rouen and Chancellor to three French monarchs. He is represented in the Grouped Parish logo by the quill of the scribe.\nThe furnishings in the Sanctuary are mainly a memorial to Capt. Ian Oswald Lidell, VC, 5th Battalion Coldstream Guards, killed in action in 1945. The stained glass windows are memorials to the Evill and Bragington families. One of the gravestones, to a Christopher Cooper who died on 8 April 1680, indicates that the churchyard is much older than the present church building.\nUntil the late 19th century the village had three water mills, producing paper, carpets and cloth. These were called Lady Mill, Lark Mill and Linnet Mill. The last owner, John Birt, closed the mills down in 1876 after being accused of polluting Mounton Brook. According to Fred Hando one of the mills produced the paper used for Bank of England notes, but a monograph by local historian Ivor Waters states that they \"rarely made anything but brown and blue packing paper\", using old rags, rope and straw as raw materials.\nMounton House, now a special school for boys, was built as a country house in the Arts and Crafts style in 1914 by Henry Avray Tipping, a leading garden designer and writer, assisted by local architect Eric Francis.\nRobin Williams, coach to Great Britain's 2012 Olympic women's pairs rowing champions Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, is from Mounton. He learnt to row at Monmouth School and went on to win world silver and bronze medals and coached Cambridge to seven Boat Race wins. His GB pair won world gold in a new world record at the world championships in Amsterdam in August 2014."

Built in the eighteenth century as a shooting box, it was vastly expanded by the Rolls family in three stages throughout the nineteenth century and is most famous as the childhood home of Charles Stewart Rolls, co-founder of Rolls-Royce. The house is Grade II* Listed and is now the clubhouse of the Rolls of Monmouth Golf Club.\nThe Welsh word hendre comes from the old Welsh custom of having two residences: one down in the valley, which was used in winter (hendre) and the other homestead was up in the mountains, where the family would live over the summer: hafod; haf being the Welsh word for \"summer\".

                        "_text": "The ton is a unit of measure. It has a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and uses over the years. It is used principally as a unit of mass. Its original use as a measurement of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in terms such as the freight ton. It can also be used as a measure of energy, for truck classification, or as a colloquial term.\nIt is derived from the tun, the term applied to a barrel of the largest size. This could contain a volume between 175 and 213 imperial gallons (210 and 256 US gal), which could weigh around 2,000 pounds (910 kg) and occupy some 60 cubic feet (1.7 m3) of space.\nIn the United Kingdom the ton is defined as 2,240 pounds (1,016 kg) (avoirdupois pounds). From 1965 the UK embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units, including the tonne (metric ton), defined as 1000 kg (2,204.6 lbs). The UK Weights and Measures Act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms, including the ton and the term \"metric ton\" for \"tonne\".\nIn the United States and formerly Canada a ton is defined to be 2,000 pounds (907 kg).\nWhere confusion is possible, the 2240 lb ton is called \"long ton\" and the 2000 lb ton \"short ton\"; the tonne is distinguished by its spelling, but usually pronounced the same as ton, hence the US term \"metric ton\". In the UK the final \"e\" of \"tonne\" can also be pronounced (\/\u02c8t\u028cn\u026a\/), or \"metric ton\" when it is necessary to make the distinction.\nWhere accuracy is required the correct term must be used, but for many purposes this is not necessary: the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6%, and the short ton is within 11% of both. The ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech.\nThe term \"ton\" is also used to refer to a number of units of volume, ranging from 35 to 100 cubic feet (0.99 to 2.83 m3) in capacity.\nIt can also be used as a unit of energy, expressed as an equivalent of coal burnt or TNT detonated.\nIn refrigeration, a ton is a unit of power, sometimes called a ton of refrigeration. It is the power required to melt or freeze one short ton of ice per day. The refrigeration ton\u00b7hour is a unit of energy, the energy required to melt or freeze 1\u204424 short ton of ice."

The name of the village derives from Welsh and means \"the town (tre) of stones (llech)\"; there are three standing stones close to the village, known as Harold's Stones. The church of St Nicholas is a Grade I listed building. The village is located on a plateau between the valleys of the Usk to the west and Wye to the east.\nAlthough a relatively small village in modern times, it was one of the largest towns in Wales in the 13th century, and is now the location of archaeological investigations to determine its extent and role at that time. The village is designated as a Conservation Area, and gives its name to the community of Trellech United, in which it is located. There are historically 26 known spellings of the village name; on each of the three roads entering the village, signs give a different spelling - Trellech, Trelleck and Trelech."
