At the 2001 Census, the population of Caerwys community was 10,315, with a total ward population of 20,496. Following reorganisation the community population fell dramatically at the 2011 Census to 1,283 with the ward falling to 2,569.\nCaerwys is mentioned in the Domesday Book as a small market town. The well-maintained church is dedicated to St. Michael. It has two parallel naves. The oldest part of the building is a stone tower whose base is said to have been part of a Roman observation tower. Contained within the church is the cover slab of a tomb reputed to have been that of Elizabeth Ferrers, the wife of Dafydd ap Gruffudd, prince of Wales (d. 1283). A short, informative booklet about the church was written in 1936 and updated in 1995. As well as being surrounded by areas of outstanding natural beauty and views across mountains and valleys, the centre of Caerwys has been designated a conservation area.\nCaerwys and Philadelphia have important historical connections. Local doctor, Thomas Wynne, sailed to America on the ship Welcome in 1682 with William Penn. Wynne was one of the founding fathers of Philadelphia and became the first speaker of the Provisional Assembly, as well as a provincial judge. The original street plan of Philadelphia was designed on the street pattern of Caerwys. Many Welsh names crop up in the city, and several buildings built in Philadelphia resemble buildings in the Caerwys area, some of which still stand today.\nCaerwys also hosted two of the most important eisteddfodau of the early modern era, one in 1523, during in the reign of Henry VIII of England at which Tudur Aled was present and the other, sanctioned by Elizabeth I, in 1568.\n\n^ 2001 Census: Caerwys (Parish), Office for National Statistics, retrieved 15 June 2008 \n^ 2001 Census: Caerwys (Ward), Office for National Statistics, retrieved 15 June 2008 \n^ \"Community population 2011\".

It overlooks Point of Ayr on the west side of the River Dee estuary and its sandy beaches with dunes. The hills of the Clwydian Range behind the village form the eastern boundary of the Vale of Clwyd. Gwespyr also looks respectively Welsh but is an alien name. It represents Old English for 'West-bury' which came to be interpreted as the 'west fort' meaning the western most fort in Mercia. Originally, it is thought to have been a strategic Mercian lookout which was reduced in importance with the development of a fortified Rhuddlan.\n\nGwespyr is famed worldwide for its top quality stone quarried in quantity from Roman times and shipped all around the world. \"Gwespyr Stone\" as it became known had a fine grain and colour also a remarkable quality of cutting and shaping. It was used for many buildings around Gwespyr. It was also used to build the ancient Maen Achwyfan at Whitford, the chapel at St Winefride's Well in Holywell, stone carvings in Rhuddlan Castle and Denbigh Castle, St Asaph Cathedral, The Talacre Arms Public house in Gwespyr and Basingwerk Abbey in Greenfield, Flintshire. Gwespyr stone was also found on sites such as Prestatyn Castle and the Roman bathhouse located in Prestatyn. There is plenty of evidence of the stone industry in Gwespyr prevalent even today, though all but one quarry is disused. The quarry in use today is home to Delyn Metal."

It may have been referred to as Lixwm Green, or Lixum Green, for a period in the 19th century.\nLewis's 1843 Topographical Dictionary of Wales noted that at that time the majority of the population of Ysceifiog parish lived in Lixwm and were mainly employed in mines in the neighbouring parishes. Even at that time, however, the population was declining due to the closure of some mines.\n\n"

It originally comprised the townships of Gronant, Gwespyr, Kelston, Golden Grove, Picston, Trewaelod, Axtyn and Trelogan.\nNamed after Saint Asaph the village is known to have existed since at least c.600 AD and was originally called Llanasaph meaning the Church of Saint Asaph. It was where the tomb and relics of Saint Asaph were enshrined before they were moved to the larger St Asaph Cathedral sometime before 1281. This ancient parish church was later the burial place of Gruffudd Fychan (the father of Owain Glynd\u0175r). The stone slab which covered his tomb survives and is engraved with the words HIC LACET GRVFVD VACHAN or \"here lies Gruffudd Fychan\". This slab, according to records, was originally in the centre of the south aisle and it would appear that Gruffudd Fychan was buried somewhere in this church sometime between 1350 and 1370. His mortal remains have not been found.\nWelsh relatives of Glynd\u0175r, known as the Hughes of Gwerclas family, continued to live in the area during the 18th and 19th Centuries."

                    "_text": "A mold (US) or mould (UK \/ NZ \/ AU \/ ZA \/ CA) is a fungus that grows in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae. In contrast, fungi that can adopt a single celled growth habit are called yeasts.\nMolds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species where the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. Cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. The dusty texture of many molds is caused by profuse production of asexual spores (conidia) formed by differentiation at the ends of hyphae. The mode of formation and shape of these spores is traditionally used to classify molds. Many of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in its life-cycle.\nMolds are considered to be microbes and do not form a specific taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping, but can be found in the divisions Zygomycota and Ascomycota. In the past, most molds were classified within the Deuteromycota.\nMolds cause biodegradation of natural materials, which can be unwanted when it becomes food spoilage or damage to property. They also play important roles in biotechnology and food science in the production of various foods, beverages, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and enzymes. Some diseases of animals and humans can be caused by certain molds: disease may result from allergic sensitivity to mold spores, from growth of pathogenic molds within the body, or from the effects of ingested or inhaled toxic compounds (mycotoxins) produced by molds."

Mynydd Isa was originally a small hamlet on the north side of the Mold to Buckley road (now the A549 road) just downhill from the now demolished Calvinist chapel. It does not appear on Ordnance Survey maps until 1912.\nIts placename is Welsh for \"lower mountain\".\nAnother old hamlet nearby was Pant-y-Fownog, on the same road nearer Buckley (centred on the Griffin Inn); although the name was used well into the 1900s on picture postcards of the area and by the local Co-Op shop next to the Inn. The name has long since become disused (except for lending its name to a road in nearby Buckley).\nBryn-y-Baal [\u02ccbr\u0268\u031en\u0259\u02c8b\u0251\u02d0l] is an old hamlet much enlarged since the 1970s and now contiguous with but not part of Mynydd Isa. Bryn-y-Baal takes its name from a Middle English word \"bale\" (rhymes with \"Carl\") meaning small hill. It was later written in a Welsh language form as 'b\u00e2l' with a circumflex over the \"\u00e2\". In Welsh this is pronounced as a long A. This form appears on early Ordnance Survey maps. Eventually it was written in the Anglicised form 'Baal' - still correctly pronounced to rhyme with \"Carl\".\nIn the area there is a secondary school known as Argoed High School in Bryn-y-Baal and a primary school Ysgol Mynydd Isa - the Junior department being in Bryn-y-Baal (formerly Ysgol y Bryn and before that Mynydd Isa Junior School), and the Infants department (formerly known as Wat's Dyke Infant School) on a separate site in Mynydd Isa.\nAmenities include a pub, The Griffin on Mold Road. (The Mercia on Mercia Drive closed in 2010), various shops and the village centre which houses the library and other clubs and associations.\nThe village has a large youth organisation (established in 1984) with football teams representing the village in the county league from 7 to 16 years old and adult football dating back to the 1930s; however the adult team disbanded in 2009.\nThe village also has a large social media following through the Facebook page: 'The Mynydd Isa Chronicles.'\n^ Flintshire Place Names by Hwyl Wyn Owen ISBN 978-0-7083-1242-1 (1995)"

The community population taken at the 2011 census was 585.\nThe older, Anglicised spelling of Nerquis can sometimes be found.\nIt has a small school and a local bus service to Mold which is around 3 miles away.\nNercwys lies on the eastern fringe of the Clwydians, and is served by a network of lanes. The modern settlement straggles along a shelf that interrupts the prevailing south-west to north-east slope. The River Terrig, a tributary of the Alyn, runs northwards less than one kilometre to the east.\nThe origins of this settlement are obscure. The shape of the churchyard might indicate an early medieval origin but there is no convincing evidence to corroborate the theory.\nThe church, an ancient chapelry of Mold, is first documented in 1291, when the place was termed Nerchgwys. The meaning of the name is obscure but could combine either 'hanner' [half] or 'anner' [heifer] with 'cwys' [furrow]. The development of Nercwys through the Middle Ages and even into the post-medieval era remains to be elucidated. The first depiction on an estate map of 1734 shows Plas-yn-llan to the south of the churchyard, the White Lion Inn at the crossroads and a small number of dwellings scattered along the road.\nIn Nercwys you can find a Grade 1 listed Welsh Fortified border house which is referred to as TOWER. It is the only Welsh fortified border house still standing and has been in the same family for six centuries and is still privately owned. Over the decades the building has had many additions, including a tower and battlements which Mr Wynne-Eyton (The current occupier) thinks date from the 18th Century and belong to the early Gothic Revival period. This now gentrified home of was referred to by the 15 th century poet Hywel Cilcan as \u201cthe fair Tower \u2026.a fortress twenty fathoms high\u201d. Rheinallt ap Gryfydd ap Bleddyn, who features in the continuous border warfare of the time, hung the Mayor of Chester in the dining hall at TOWER in 1465. An iron staple in the ceiling of the medieval dining hall marks the spot. The family motto \u201cHeb dduw, heb ddim\u201d, which translates as \u201cwithout God there is nothing\u201d, is carved over the fireplace and stained glass windows in the building display the family coat of arms\nThe parish church is dedicated to St Mary, dates back to the 1100s and is a grade II* listed building."

At the 2001 Census, the village of Northop Hall had a population of 1,665, falling to 1,530 at the 2011 census.\nThe village has one pub, the Boar's Head; until recently there was a second, the Black Lion, and they were universally known locally as the 'Top Monkey' and 'Bottom Monkey'. There are active cricket and hockey clubs.\nThe hall that gives the village its name is a 13th-century manor house which is located in close proximity to Smithy Lane and the Mold to Connah's Quay road. It was the most important house in Northop parish. It was occupied by local aristocracy including the Evans family, ancestors of author George Eliot. The original Northop Hall is now a private house and not to be confused with Northop Hall Country House Hotel which is Victorian and located elsewhere in the village."

The hills of the Clwydian Range behind the village form the eastern boundary of the Vale of Clwyd. The name Talacre is a combination of the Welsh words tal, meaning end, and acrau, meaning acres. In the north-east Welsh dialect, acrau is pronounced as acre.\n\nThe village is probably most popular for the lighthouse on the nearby beach and the Talacre Beach Caravan Park, a short walk away from the Presthaven Sands holiday park. The lighthouse has been noted for numerous ghostly sightings, people claiming to see a figure wearing old fashioned lighthouse keeper clothes and standing in front of the glass dome of the abandoned lighthouse. The lighthouse was featured in popular British television drama Skins, in the episode Skins Pure.\nTalacre was used by the military during World War II, as an aircraft firing range. Fighters flew over the remote village every day, shooting at wooden targets in the dunes and at drogues towed by aircraft. It was also used for testing new devices, such as \"window\" the anti-radar foil that, on occasion, covered the whole village with silver.\nThe village is often used as part of Paul O'Grady's comedy act, telling stories of how he spent many summers \"Stuck in a four berth caravan in Talacre\", and is therefore now part of popular culture as a famous \"typically British\" seaside holiday resort.\nPart of the beach where the lighthouse is situated has been shown briefly in a recent Dulux paint advert with the Old English Sheep Dog mascot."

The village in history was the locality for several lead-zinc mines, working at least until 1841.\nMany people in Japan are familiar with Trelogan, as UK scientists developed a process to plant the semi-toxic, at least to plants, spoil tips from the lead-zinc mines with native UK plant species. Up to this point it had not been possible to grow plants on this type of semi-toxic terrain which was common in Japan due to the many lead-zinc mines in operation."

At the 2001 census the community had a population of 245, falling slightly to 241 at the 2011 census. The North Wales Expressway (A55) crosses the community from east to west, on its route from Chester to Bangor.\nThe farmhouse at Bodeugan, in the north of the community, dates from the 17th century, and is Grade II* listed. The Flintshire county archives at Hawarden contain a letter dated Christmas 1812, in which the then tenant, Robert Roberts, complained that the house was bewitched, recounting a series of poltergeist activity in which stones, coals, dung and water were thrown at the inhabitants, windows were broken and milk churns smashed. On Christmas Eve, the spirit was claimed to have thrown the servants out of their beds. Pont Dafydd, built in 1630 across the River Clwyd, but now standing in a field since the river was diverted, is an ancient monument and is Grade II listed."
