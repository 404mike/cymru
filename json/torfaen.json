It is named after the first station master of Pontypool and New Inn railway station (then known as Pontypool Road), Henry Griffiths. Griffiths founded a 'terminating' Building Society to finance the construction of houses in the village so that his workforce could become freehold owner-occupiers, rather than constructing rental or leasehold housing as was the more usual practice in industrial South Wales and Monmouthshire. He lived in the substantial St. Dunstan's House (now demolished) on what is now Commercial Street and his memorial is in St Hilda's Church. Today the site is occupied by a nursing home and a modern house of the same name."

The ruins of a building 10 feet by 8 feet with walls four feet thick and traces of an arch on the north side existed on the site of the police training college. It is thought this was associated with Llantarnam Priory.\nThe Police Training College (known as CENTREX) closed for the training of new recruits from April 2006. On August 6, 2008, Prisons Minister David Hanson announced a shortlist of four possible locations for a new Prison in Wales. The CENTREX site was a candidate, but there were strong protests. In February 2009 it was announced that the new prison would be located in Caernarfon, however as from September 2009, plans for this prison have also been abandoned."
