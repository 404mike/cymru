It was formerly part of the ancient parish of Ruabon, and is located between the towns of Wrexham and Llangollen. It is close to the villages of Trefor, Cefn Mawr, Ruabon and Plas Madoc. The name Acrefair originates from the Welsh word for acres - acrau, or acre in the local Welsh dialect - and Mair, the Welsh name for Mary. We therefore have Acre-Mair, which leads to Acre-fair, as there is a soft mutation on the second element of a composite word. The English meaning of Acrefair is Mary's Acres.\nParts of Acrefair have beautiful views across the River Dee and the Dee Valley. Acrefair has a newsagents, a petrol station, a post office, a chemist and two Chinese take-aways. It boasts many buildings built from \"Ruabon Red brick\", including several chapels which are now closed and converted.(citation)\nEdward Lloyd Rowland established an ironworks here in c.1817. Following his bankruptcy in 1825 the works were bought by the British Iron Company. The company was re-formed in 1843 as the New British Iron Company and they continued to operate the works until its closure in 1887. The site was subsequently occupied by a succession of businesses, latterly Air Products, which produced air separation equipment for industry. The site ceased to be a commercial venture in late 2009.\nAcrefair and Cefn Mawr were also home to the Monsanto Company chemical works, which had produced chemicals since before World War II. The site was the American company's first venture in Europe. Monsanto later operated the site as FlexSys, one of their subsidiaries, but production on this site ceased in 2010.\nCoal, clay and iron were also worked in the area during its industrial period.\nAcrefair railway station was formerly a station on the Ruabon to Barmouth line, it closed to passengers on Monday 18 January 1965 as part of the Beeching Axe. The Ruabon Brook Tramway passed through the village at street level, serving the Monsanto works and other local industry."

The origin of its name is unclear but is thought to have a Welsh-language root. It has also been referred to as \"Big Arowry\", or \"Great Arowry\", in order to distinguish it from the hamlet of Little Arowry around a mile to the north near Horseman's Green.\nAlfred Palmer, the Wrexham historian, noted that the area called Arowry, before enclosure, was a \"great heath\" sometimes given the Welsh name \"Yr owredd\", and colloquially referred to as \"the Rowrey\", or \"the Arowry\". Thomas Gwynn Jones suggested that the name Owredd was originally derived from a Welsh pronunciation of the English name \"Overheath\".\nThe nineteenth-century philologist Alexander John Ellis studied the dialect of a native of Arowry, John Heatley, as part of his work, published in On Early English Pronunciation, on English dialects. The unusual dialect of the Hanmer area was later studied in the Survey of English Dialects.\nThe village is near the A539 road and is 10 kilometres (6 mi) west of the nearest major town, Whitchurch in Shropshire."

The northern part is in the borough of Camden and the southern part in the City of Westminster.\nThe street originated as an early medieval lane called Via de Aldwych, which probably connected St Giles Leper Hospital with the fields of Aldwych Close, owned by the hospital but traditionally said to have been granted to the Danes as part of a peace treaty with Alfred the Great in Saxon times. It acquired its name from the Suffolk barrister Sir Robert Drury, who built a mansion called Drury House on the lane around 1500. After the death in 1615 of his great-great-grandson, another Robert Drury, the property passed out of the family. It became the London house of the Earl of Craven, then a public house under the sign of his reputed mistress, the Queen of Bohemia. Subsequently the gardens and courtyards of the house were built over with rows of small houses. The remains of the house itself, which had been progressively demolished, were finally cleared in 1809. By this time Drury Lane had become one of the worst slums in London, dominated by prostitution and gin palaces. The area was eventually cleared to make way for the developments of Kingsway and Aldwych.\nThe name of the street is often used to refer to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, which has in different incarnations been located in Drury Lane since the 17th century, even though today the main entrance is on Catherine Street. Also in Drury Lane is the New London Theatre.\nThe street Drury Lane is where The Muffin Man lives as mentioned in the popular nursery rhyme, and also where the harlot of William Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress practises her profession.\n173 Drury Lane was the location of the first J Sainsbury store, now one of the UK's largest retailers. The store was opened in 1869.\n191 Drury Lane was the location of the Workers' Educational Society in 1847\/48. \n^ a b Bebbington, Gillian (1988) [1972]. Street Names of London. Batsford. p. 115.

The community, also including the villages of Summerhill and Bradley, had a total population of 10,056 at the 2001 census.\nThe name is usually stated to be derived from the Welsh word, gwersyll, meaning \"campsite\", with the final t common in the area's dialect. This is, however, a comparatively modern form, and during the mediaeval period the name was written as \"Wershull\" or \"Wersull\", with \"Gwershull\" and \"Wersham\" occurring in the 16th century. It is therefore possible that the present name, like others in the area, is a Welsh adaptation of an earlier English name ending in \"-hull\" (i.e. \"hill\").\n\n"

The waterway links Llangollen in Denbighshire, north Wales, with Hurleston in south Cheshire, via the town of Ellesmere, Shropshire. In 2009 an eleven-mile section of the canal from Gledrid Bridge near Rhoswiel through to the Horseshoe Falls, which includes Chirk Aqueduct and Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, was declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO.\nThe waterway, from which the modern canal takes it name, was built when work to complete the Ellesmere Canal was halted in the early 19th century. The Ellesmere Canal was to be a commercial waterway that linked the Port of Liverpool to the West Midlands. However due to a variety of problems, such as rising costs and rival competition, the scheme was never finished as intended. As the waterway never reached its proposed main source of water at Moss Valley, Wrexham, a feeder channel was constructed along the side of the Vale of Llangollen to the River Dee; the work created the Horseshoe Falls at Llantisilio.\nThe Llangollen line became the primary water source from the River Dee for the central section of the incomplete Ellesmere Canal. As such it was not built as a broad-gauge waterway but as a navigable feeder branch. Eventually the Ellesmere Canal became part of the Shropshire Union network in 1846.\nIn the 1980s, British Waterways took the decision to rename the surviving central sections of the Ellesmere Canal as the Llangollen Canal. As a rebranding of Britain's industrial waterways as leisure destinations, it has encouraged usage and promoted restoration.\n\n"

The individual plants are usually composed of simple, one-cell thick leaves, covering a thin stem that supports them but does not conduct water and nutrients (nonvascular). They do not have seeds or any vascular tissue. At certain times they produce thin stalks topped with capsules containing spores. They are typically 1\u201310 cm (0.4\u20133.9 in) tall, though some species are much larger, like Dawsonia, the tallest moss in the world, which can grow to 50 cm (20 in) in height.\nMosses are commonly confused with lichens, hornworts, and liverworts. Lichens may superficially look like mosses, and have a common names that includes the word \"moss\" (e.g., \"reindeer moss\" or \"iceland moss\"), but are not related to mosses. Mosses, hornworts, and liverworts are collectively called \"bryophytes\". Bryophytes share the properties of not having vascular tissue and producing spores instead of flowers and seeds. Bryophytes have the haploid gametophyte generation as the dominant phase of the life cycle. This contrasts with the pattern in all vascular plants (seed plants and pteridophytes), where the diploid sporophyte generation is dominant.\nMosses are in the phylum (division) Bryophyta, which formerly also included hornworts and liverworts. These other two groups of bryophytes are now placed in their own divisions. There are approximately 12,000 species of moss classified in the Bryophyta.\nThe main commercial use of mosses is for decorative purposes, such as in gardens and in the florist trade. Traditional uses of mosses included as insulation and for the ability to absorb liquids up to 20 times their weight."

It is contiguous with the neighbouring villages of Moss and Brynteg.\nThe village's name is derived from the Welsh word pentre (\"village\") along with Broughton, the name of the township of the parish of Wrexham (later Brymbo) in which it was located. The English place-name \"Broughton\" appears in the Domesday Book survey of the area and probably means \"brook town\".\nMuch of the village dates from the later 19th century, after industrial expansion in the area, but it appears on the 1873 Ordnance Survey of Denbighshire as \"Pentre\" and \"Pentre isaf\" (\"lower village\"). These place names, rather than \"Pentre Broughton\", appear on maps until the second half of the 20th century, and the village is still often referred to simply as \"Pentre\" by local residents.\nPentre Broughton's church, St. Paul's, was built in 1888-89, though it was not consecrated until 1909, shortly before Broughton was made a separate parish in its own right. The church was designed by the architect Howel Davies of Wrexham.\nMany of the villages' residents worked in coal mining, or in the Brymbo Steelworks which until its closure in 1990 dominated the view to the north of the village. The Cross Foxes on Pentre High Street was formerly the meeting place for the area's mineworkers' unions; at one 19th century meeting, over 6000 people gathered there for a demonstration."

It is situated on the B5445 road, to the south west of Chester and on the border with Wales. It is believed that the name of the village is derived from the Welsh words Pwll \"marsh\" and Ffordd \"crossing\". According to the 2001 Census, the population of the entire parish was 395, increasing to 580 at the 2011 Census.\nThe parish has several notable buildings, including a castle, a church and a hotel.\nPulford Castle, which no longer exsts, only the mound of the castle remains just behind the church of S Mary, was a small Norman motte-and-bailey defensive structure, exists on the outskirts of the village. The castle was built at a strategic location protecting a road at a river crossing. Although no firm date of construction is recorded, it is believed to have been built around 1100. The castle is mentioned as having a garrison stationed at it, during the revolt of Owain Glynd\u0175r in 1403.\nPulford Parish Church is named after St. Mary. The church was rebuilt in 1844, to a design by the architect John Douglas, the benefactor being Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. Mention of a church on the site can be traced back the 12th century and the first rector is mentioned in ancient records as Hugo. The church's spire is 120 feet high. In the 1980s a fire completely destroyed the roof of the church tower, however it was later restored.\nA large hotel exists in the village, called the Grosvenor Pulford Hotel. Grosvenor is the family name of the Duke of Westminster whose seat is at nearby Eaton Hall."

Although clearly located in Rhosrobin, the Rhosddu Industrial Estate takes its name from the old colliery that once occupied this whole area. The colliery was opened in the 1860s by The Wrexham Coal Company and at its peak employed almost 1000 men. The colliery closed in 1924. The only surviving building can be seen at the rear of the estate \u2013 the old wheelhouse is currently occupied by a pallets business.\nThe Churchlea development to the side of the Olivet Christadelphian Chapel was built on the site of the disused North Wales Mineral Railway Company railway track. The route of the old track can be seen opposite Churchlea making its way to the long since gone Wheatsheaf junction in Gwersyllt.\nThe short unadopted road running to the rear of the Chapel originally ran the full length of the land down to the main railway line, giving access to a cottage built beside the track and also to two long terraces of houses built on higher ground. Although the terraced properties were demolished in the 1970s, the land remained undeveloped until very recently. The cottage was demolished to make way for the Churchlea development.\nThe village was served briefly by its own railway station, Rhosrobin Halt, which was actually situated in Pandy, opposite what is now known as the Pandy Business Park. The Halt was opened in 1932 by the Great Western Railway Co. and closed in October 1947. Very little remains of the structure, which was used mainly by colliers who worked at the large Gresford Colliery nearby.\nContinuing along the B5425, the former St Peter\u2019s Church building remains but is now a children\u2019s nursery, and the old Rhosrobin School, which had more recently seen service as a commercial laundry, has now been demolished to make way for a new housing development called St. Peter's Close. The old school bell moved with the laundry company to its new premises on Llay Industrial Estate.\nA murder was committed in Rhosrobin on Monday, 10 November 1902 when William Hughes shot his wife Jane Hannah Hughes. William Hughes was a native of Denbigh and served for many years in the Cheshire Regiment in India under the British Raj. On his return to Britain he worked as a collier in the Wrexham area. He married Jane Hannah Williams, his first cousin, in 1892. They separated in 1901 and Hughes was subsequently sentenced to three months in Shrewsbury prison for \"family desertion\". He was released on 6 November 1902 and on the 10th of the month he called upon his wife who by then was housekeeper to a Mr Tom Maddocks, a collier who was widowed with three children. When she came to the door Hughes discharged both barrels of a shotgun into her body from close range.\nHughes was tried at Denbigh Assizes in January 1903 and despite pleas of insanity the jury took just ten minutes to find him guilty of murder. At 8 a.m. on Tuesday 17 February 1903 William Hughes, 42, was executed on the gallows at Ruthin Gaol. Hughes is believed to be the only man to have been hanged at the Gaol."

At the time of the 2001 census, area Wrexham 014A, which includes Rhostyllen itself, had a population of 1,383 in 599 households. Its name may be derived from the Welsh words rhos (\"moor\", or \"rush pasture\") and estyll (\"staves\" or \"planks\").\nRhostyllen was a part of the old township of Esclusham Below (i.e. \"below\" Offa's Dyke) and in 1879 was incorporated into the new ecclesiastical parish of Esclusham. The parish church, Holy Trinity, was completed in 1877. The corresponding civil parish of Esclusham became the community of Esclusham in 1974.\nRhostyllen is a former mining village, with Bersham (or Glanyrafon) Colliery, which before closure in December 1986 was the last working coal mine in the Denbighshire coalfield, situated to the east of Wrexham Road. Like other villages in the area, many of its buildings are nineteenth-century miners' houses built in the distinctive local \"Ruabon Red\" brick. This character is under threat as the village becomes increasingly linked to the outskirts of Wrexham by infill and commercial development along the A483 road.\nThe focal point of the village is the village hall, built in 1924, and its recreation grounds. Rhostyllen's railway station was closed to passengers as long ago as 1931; the village was also formerly served by the line of the Wrexham and District Electric Tramways Company, opened in 1903, which ran from Penybryn in Wrexham to Johnstown and Rhosllannerchrugog: the halfway passing loop was situated at the Black Lion in Rhostyllen. Rhostyllen is served by the A483 trunk road.\nThe eighteenth-century house and parkland at Erddig, now owned by the National Trust, is nearby.\n\n"

The village of Tregeiriog and the surrounding area were transferred to the parish of Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog in the late 1980s. Although the village had no church, there was formerly a small Calvinistic Methodist chapel in Tregeiriog.\nTregeiriog was also in the corresponding civil parish of Llangadwaladr; subsequent to the 1972 Local Government Act it was placed in the community of Ceiriog Ucha.\nThe cartographer Samuel Lewis, in his 1849 edition of A Topographical Dicitionary of Wales, recorded that \"the inhabitants have a tradition, that there were formerly a church and a considerable town at Tregeiriog; and in ploughing the land, quantities of large paving stones have been thrown up at different times, which seemed to have been placed in regular order: the name of a farm, Pen-yr-h\u00f4wl, the \"head of the street,\" is also adduced in corroboration\"."
