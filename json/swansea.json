The berry is the most common type of fleshy fruit in which the entire ovary wall ripens into an edible pericarp. They may have one or more carpels. The seeds are usually embedded in the fleshy interior of the ovary, but there are some non-fleshy exceptions, such as peppers, that have air rather than pulp around their seeds.\nA plant that bears berries is said to be bacciferous or baccate (a plant that resembles a berry, whether it actually is a berry or not, can also be called \"baccate\").\nIn everyday English, \"berry\" is a term for any small edible fruit. Berries are usually juicy, round, brightly coloured, sweet or sour, and do not have a stone or pit, although many seeds may be present.\nMany berries, such as the tomato, are edible, but others in the same family, such as the fruits of the potato (Solanum tuberosum) and the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) are poisonous to humans."

The village takes its name from a 17th-century inn.\nThe village marks one end of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest along which the Triassic cliffs have geological interest for the variety of fossils. The coloured alabaster found in the cliffs gave rise to the name of the colour \"Watchet Blue\". It is on the West Somerset Coast Path.\n\nBlue Anchor railway station is a station on the West Somerset Railway, a heritage railway in Somerset. It is situated in the village and houses the museum of the West Somerset Steam Railway Trust.\nWithin the village is the only example of an updraught brick kiln known to have survived in Somerset. It was built around 1830, supplied by small vessels carrying limestone to the small culm landing, and is now used as a garage. The kiln is thought to have been used until the 1870s when the large-scale production of bricks in Bridgwater rendered small brickyards uneconomic.\nMarshwood farmhouse dates from the late 15th century and was originally a manor house or grange. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building.\nCoincidentally there is another Blue Anchor Inn directly north across the Bristol Channel in East Aberthaw, The Vale of Glamorgan."

Served by Bryn railway station, Bryn is home to the Three Sisters Recreation Area which has been created from three large spoil tips which remain from Bryn's role in Lancashire's coal mining past. The Three Sisters Recreation Area is also the site of the Three Sisters Race Circuit, which provides race driving instruction and plays host to kart racing events and motorcycle road race meetings at clubman level.\nThe former Bryn (or Brynne) Hall was the seat of the Gerard family beginning in the thirteenth century or earlier. It was a \"safe house\" for the English Roman Catholic martyr and saint Edmund Arrowsmith and his hand was reportedly preserved there after his execution. The house, dating to the fourteenth century, has now completely collapsed and remaining stones been cleared.\nThe Unitarian Park Lane Chapel in Wigan Road was built in 1697, though its congregation was founded in 1662. It is the oldest Non-conformist chapel and congregation in the whole district. By the nineteenth century Park Lane was only one of nine non-conformist chapels in the heavily recusant area."

Aside from the student population, this is a fairly middle-class area.\nBrynmill is approximately bounded by Swansea Bay to the south; Brynmill Lane to the west; Glanbrydan Avenue to the north; Bryn-y-Mor Road to the north-east; and Guildhall Road to the south-east. Brynmill can be further subdivided between the upland area of Brynmill proper and the lowland area of St. Helen's close the sea.\nBrynmill is situated on hilly terrain. Many of the properties are built on slopes. Property subsidence is a problem here. Property prices here are around the national average. Council tax rates here are quite high. The area offers convenient access to the city centre shopping area via the Oystermouth Road to the South, and Sketty Road to the North.

It is located about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) north west of Swansea city centre.\nCockett, in common with much of western Swansea, was the result of late Victorian and early twentieth century expansion. More housing estates were developed during the 20th Century and further housing was constructed near the Townhill district in the early 2000s. The area now has a broad mix of housing stock. 83 per cent of the property in the Cockett neighbourhood is owner occupied. The South Wales Police regional headquarters for Swansea was based in Cockett, as is Dylan Thomas Community School. The South Wales Police regional headquarters now resides closer to the city centre however. There are a few shops in central Cockett, but the nearest shopping districts are on Carmarthen Road (A483) to the north and the Swansea West Business Park to the north west.\nThe main road through Cockett is the A4216 road linking Sketty to the south with Fforestfach to the north. Cockett railway station is a currently disused railway station to the north, by Station Road. The old platforms on the West Wales Lines are still in place and there are proposals by South West Wales Integrated Transport Consortium to reinstate this station in the future, which would provide a 10-minute journey to Swansea railway station in the city centre. Cockett is served by First Cymru buses from Swansea bus station: numbers 15 and 17 to Gowerton; number 43 to Morriston Hospital and numbers 400 and 404 to Llanelli."

Hafod is the home to the Hafod Copperworks, founded in 1810 and closed in 1980 which is now being developed into an industrial heritage site.\nThe word hafod is Welsh for 'summer dwelling' (compare sheiling) or 'farm', and refers to the seasonal cycle of transhumance - the movement of livestock and people from a lowland winter pasture at the main residence (Welsh hendre) to a higher summer pasture from roughly May through October.\nThe western part of Hafod is a residential suburb. In the late 20th century, this was a mostly run-down area of Swansea, with property prices there being some of the lowest in the city centre area. In the new millennium, many properties in the main Neath Road (B4603) and some of the side streets have benefited from council grants to improve the fa\u00e7ade of the properties. Beside the River Tawe to the east is a small industrial strip around Morfa Road.\nHafod has a comprehensive school called Pentrehafod School, and a primary school called Hafod Primary school. There used to be junior and senior schools located on the same site but the school was ravaged by fire during the early 1990s. The new primary school was built to replace it and new buildings were constructed within the grounds of Pentrehafod school to cater for the junior and senior pupils. The community sports facility is the Pentrehafod sports hall and pool located in the grounds of the Pentrehafod Comprehensive School. The school is built on what was formerly the waste product dumping ground for the Morris family copper works.\nNeath Road is a busy thoroughfare used by buses and cars to travelling between central Swansea and the northern suburbs in and around Morriston and Llansamlet. There is a dedicated express bus route to the east of Neath Road, which is used by buses serving the Landore Park and Ride site and the 'bendy bus' service from Singleton Hospital to Morriston Hospital.\n\n"

It falls within the Mayals ward and the Mumbles community council area (MCC). The ward of Mayals lies within the constituency of Swansea West, the only MCC ward not in the Gower constituency.\nThe suburb of Mayals consists mainly of higher value privately owned housing. Located on Clyne Common near the suburb in the area is the Craig-y-Nos School, an independent school for children, whilst the well performing Mayals Primary School lies within the area. Actress Catherine Zeta-Jones once lived in the Mayals, on St Andrews Close and singer Bonnie Tyler maintains a home in Blackpill.\nMuch of the Mayals area is accounted for by Clyne common, upon which is the prestigious 18-hole Clyne golf club.\nThe renowned botanical gardens at Clyne also account for a significant amount of Mayals. The gardens include many rare, tropical and notable plans, including Britain\u2019s largest Magnolia, and many hybrids. Notable constructions include a Japanese bridge, the Admirals Tower, Gazebo, and the neo-Gothic Victorian Church. There is also a small lake, an unused quarry, family Pet Cemetery, and many hidden and secluded areas with Victorian paving and red-brick steps. However, the most notable building of all is Clyne Castle, built in 1791 by Richard Phillips a wealthy landowner. The castle and grounds were bought by the wealthy Swansea Vivian family in 1860, who made many changes to the castle and grounds. During that time the Castle hosted many notable guests, including Adelina Patti, Neville Chamberlain, Queen Victoria, Winston Churchill, and King Edward VIII and later on Jon and Carys Richards. In 1952 the Castle came under the ownership of Swansea University, becoming student accommodation. In 2003 the Castle was sold to become high value luxury apartments.\nThere is also a smaller Mayals Park, next to Mayals Primary School which unlike Clyne, has play-facilities for children as well as a small basketball court, footpaths and streams, and an unmaintained wooded area.\nIn the local council elections in 2008 Mayals (electoral ward) was won by Conservative Candidate Rene Kinzett, who stood for Swansea West in the 2010 national election. In the 2012 local council elections Linda Tyler-Lloyd retained the seat for the Conservative Party after Rene Kinzett decided to stand down."

The majority of homes were built by 1940. Maps from 1874, 1879, and 1921 confirm that prior to the Mayhill Garden City project, Townhill Farm occupied the upper end of Waun Wen Road and a well used by Baptists was located halfway down. At the end of what is now called Long Ridge (previously called Bryon Crescent) there was, and still is, a Jewish burial ground. Waun Wen Road was completed before 1938.\nPolitically, Mayhill falls within the Townhill ward. The south side of Mayhill overlooks the city centre, docklands and Swansea Bay. A prominent landmark on Mayhill, visible from the city centre and Hafod is Sea View Primary School (previously known as Mayhill Primary).\nMayhill consists mostly of suburban housing, however it does also feature a post office on Townhill Road, two fast food takeaways and a convenience store at the bottom of Waun Wen Road, as well as a small collection of shops at the intersection of Mayhill Road and Townhill Road. There are several churches in Mayhill including Our Lady of Lourdes, a popular Roman Catholic church, and Hill URC Church. Mayhill also features several park and nature reserve areas.\nThe largest open space recreational area is located around Sea View Primary School and includes parkland, small wooded areas, and heathland. There is also a small picnic park located along Bryn Y Don Road, and woodland between Waun Wen Road and Townhill Road.\nThe local football team is West End F.C. who play in Pryderi Park Stadium in the area."

Morriston's Orpheus Choir has been described as one of the leading Welsh choirs.\nMorriston is close to other communities, these areas include Parc Gwernfadog, Cwmrhydyceirw, Clase, Ynystawe, Ynysforgan.

The earliest evidence of it being inhabited is in 1459, where Philip Mansel was recorded as holding it. The Mansel family were a minor gentry in South Wales, who grew in power and prestige under the Tudor monarchs. The parish church of St. Illtyd's overlooks Oxwich Bay. A place of worship has stood on this site since the 6th century, but the main tower of today was built in the 14th century. The chancel of this church is thought to be a 6th-century cell. The church bell in the tower also dates back to the 14th century, but was recast in 1892. In the churchyard there is a well, which locals believe is haunted by a ghost.

The village lies to the north of the A4118, the main South Gower road between Swansea and Port Eynon, in a wooded area, at the bottom of a valley.\nThe building at the centre of the village is a former school that is now home to the West Glamorgan Girl Guides Activity Centre. Pennard golf course lies immediately to the south of the village. Parkmill is in the Gower ward of the City and County of Swansea (Welsh: Cyngor Dinas a Sir Abertawe).\nParkmill's only religious building is the Mount Pisgah United Reformed Church, a Congregational chapel, erected in 1822 and rebuilt in 1890.\nThe area is little changed from the mid 19th century, when Samuel Lewis said in his 'A Topographical Dictionary of Wales' (1849):\n\nThe hamlet of Park-Mill, forming the most populous part of the parish, [Ilston] is yet extremely rural; and the surrounding scenery, which is characterized by features of tranquillity and seclusion, is enlivened by the small rivulet called Pennarth Pill, winding along a beautiful dell, in which are the ruins of an ancient chapel. On this stream a cloth manufactory was established early in the present century, but it has been discontinued.\n\nThe 'cloth manufactory', a 12th-century water powered corn and saw mill, at Parkmill has since been renovated and a rural crafts centre sited in it, called the Gower Heritage Centre."

                        "_text": "Pentrebach (sometimes written Pentre-Bach) (translation: small village) is a village in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, Wales. It lies on the east side of the River Taff opposite Abercanaid, South of Merthyr and North of Troedyrhiw. To the east of the village lies the Mynydd Cilfach-yr-Encil which rises up to 445 m. Pentrebach can be translated as \"Little Village\"\nPentrebach is part of the Plymouth electoral ward which covers Pentrebach, Abercanaid and Troedyrhiw. The village was founded at the time that John Guest built the Plymouth Ironworks in 1763. The name Guest became part of the Guest, Keen and Nettelfold company (GKN). In 1818 Anthony Hill took over ownership of the business. His House was later used as an old people's home, and today has been converted into a Brewers Fayre Restaurant with a Premier Inn attached.\n\nThe original Merthyr Tramroad, built in 1802, ran alongside the site of the modern day village, on it way from Pennydarren to Abercynon, though very little of the village had been built at that time. A tunnel still exists, which can be visited on the Merthyr Road. Locomotives had to tip their chimneys while going though this tunnel due to the tunnel clearance.\nPentrebach has its own railway station. This opened in 1886 on the standard gauge Taff Vale Railway which runs from Cardiff to Merthyr alongside the River Taff. The original purpose of the railway was to carry iron ore to Cardiff Docks.\nIn 1862, on the south side of the Village, The South Duffryn Colliery was opened with two shafts which were 250 m deep. At the height of the production there were some 1300 men employed there. An opencast mine was also located on the mountainside above the village.\nThe Plymouth Ironworks closed in 1882 and the South Duffryn Colliery ceased production in 1940.\n\nAfter the war, new industries were attracted to the village. In 1945, the Kayser Bondor Factory opened making underwear, followed in 1948 by the establishment of the Hoover factory manufacturing washing machines. The factory later went on the produce the Sinclair C5 battery-powered three-wheeler car. On Friday, 6 March 2009, Hoover confirmed that it was to cease production of washing machines and other laundry products at the factory. Linde has set up a factory in the village on a site where the South Duffryn Colliery was located.\nPentrebach has two clubs: The Hills Plymouth Cricket Club, and the Pentrebach Working men's club. Pentrebach also has a chapel, Jerusalem Chapel, Greenfield School and an Integrated Children's Centre.\nThe mountain above Pentrebach has become popular with hang glider pilots in recent years."

According to a legend, seven Franciscan friars were beheaded on top of this hill. Wooden crosses were built in the location since the early 17th century. It soon became a symbol of the city and an integral part of the city's skyline. As wood rots, the crosses needed to be periodically replaced. In 1916, a concrete monument was designed by Polish\u2013Lithuanian architect and sculptor Antoni Wiwulski. It was torn down in 1950 by order of the Soviet authorities. A new monument designed by Henrikas \u0160ilgalis was erected in its place in 1989. The monument was depicted on 50 litas banknote. A spectacular panorama of the Vilnius Old Town can be observed from a small observation deck at the base of the crosses."

                        "_text": "Ynysforgan is a village in Swansea, Glamorgan, Wales. It lies just off Junction 45 of the M4 motorway, geographically between Morriston and Ynystawe. The origins of its name are not known for certain but ynys is Welsh for a river-meadow (i.e., an \"island\" \u2013 the main meaning of ynys \u2013 in otherwise marshier ground beside a river) and Forgan is a mutation of the name Morgan; a reasonable translation of the name would therefore be Morgan's Meadow. The River Tawe flows past Ynysforgan so it is not unreasonable to speculate that it is the river in question. Several other nearby locations also use the term Ynys in their names including Ynystawe (the neighbouring village to Ynysforgan), Ynystanglws Farm (near Ynystawe), and Ynysmeudwy (near Pontardawe).\nHowever, as historically insignificant as Ynysforgan may seem it holds a hidden gem unknown to most locals and has its name embedded in the annals of Welsh time. In the latter part of the Middle Ages (circa 1330 - 1403) Ynysforgan was the home of Hopcyn ap Tomas ab Einion. This clearly indicates the name Ynysforgan extends back further than the 15th century and given the 'modernisation' of language it's conceivable its name is derived from old Welsh. Historians have speculated that ab Einion was responsible for a manuscript titled the Red Book of Hergest which is one of the most important medieval Welsh language manuscripts. Furthermore, in 1403 ab Einion was summoned to Carmarthen by none other than Owain Glynd\u0175r, the last true Prince of Wales to shed light on his fate by bringing his knowledge and expertise to bare by interpreting old bardic prophecies.[1] Click this link to view a commemorative stone dedicated to ab Einion located in Ynystawe Park.\nBefore 1963 Ynysforgan essentially comprised the main Swansea to Brecon road (now Clydach Road) with houses on either side. It is interesting to note the 1911 census shows the address as 'Clydack Road'. The 'newer' houses behind Clydach Road were built in late 1960 starting with Garth View, followed by Elizabeth Close, Ian's Walk and Orpheus Road. The builders name was Emrys Davies of Neath who was a sole trader employing skilled tradesmen. It is believed that the road names Elizabeth Close, Ian's Walk and Andrews Crescent are attributable to Mr Davies' relatives. Garth View takes its name from its aspect facing the hill opposite, known colloquially as 'The Garth'. Orpheus Road is probably in recognition of the famous Morriston Orpheus Choir.\nThe old Swansea Tram system extended up the Swansea valley as far as Llanllienwen Road where there was a halt. With the building of the M4 motorway in 1973 the geography of Ynysforgan changed dramatically. The motorway essentially cut the village in two resulting in the demolition of the old Sunday School which stood (roughly) in the vicinity of the M4 exit slip road straight on from Clydach Road and a new Sunday school was built at the top of Garth View and Christopher Road.\nUp until the mid-1970s there stood a grand house - Glyncollen - in its own grounds at the top of Garth View. Glyncollen was originally accessed by a long drive that joined the lower end of Llanllienwen Road, but this access was blocked when the motorway divided the village. In the 1930s Glyncollen House was the residence of the late Captain Sidney Davies, Managing Director of the Forest and Worcester Tinplate Works at Morriston - a brother of the late Alderman D. J. Davies of \"Firgrove\", Llanllienwen Road, a former Mayor of Swansea. He was followed as owner-occupier by the late Doctor and Mrs. N. E. Edwards-Jones, in the 1940s. The house was abandoned in the early 1970s and fell into ruin, only to be demolished later that decade. The grounds were taken over by the council and became a local amenity.\nYnysforgan used to lie on both the main Brecon to Swansea Canal which was navigable until the late 1950s and a Swansea Valley railway line. The canal was filled in and covered over in the 1960s and the route of the railway line has now been used as the Swansea valley by-pass road. There were several relics of World War II such as pillboxes and manholes along the canal: these were demolished when the canal was filled in.\n\n"
