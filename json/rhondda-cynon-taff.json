The Three Sisters Recreation Area is also the site of the Three Sisters Race Circuit, which provides race driving instruction and plays host to kart racing events and motorcycle road race meetings at clubman level.\nThe former Bryn (or Brynne) Hall was the seat of the Gerard family beginning in the thirteenth century or earlier. It was a \"safe house\" for the English Roman Catholic martyr and saint Edmund Arrowsmith and his hand was reportedly preserved there after his execution. The house, dating to the fourteenth century, has now completely collapsed and remaining stones been cleared.\nThe Unitarian Park Lane Chapel in Wigan Road was built in 1697, though its congregation was founded in 1662. It is the oldest Non-conformist chapel and congregation in the whole district. By the nineteenth century Park Lane was only one of nine non-conformist chapels in the heavily recusant area."

The village is centrally located being around 4 miles from the local principal towns of Llantrisant to the southwest and Pontypridd to the north and is situated around 10 miles northwest of Cardiff city centre. Historically it was known as Cross Inn and fell within the traditional county of Glamorgan.\nChurch Village itself does not share the extent of industrial mining heritage of much of the rest of the county and largely comprises new and recent build housing. It is a rapidly growing urban area, today almost a town rather than a village, being much sought after to live in due to its proximity to Cardiff and Pontyclun. Church Village is also commonly used to refer to the whole CF38 postcode area of Pontypridd, comprising the adjoining principal settlements of - Beddau, Efail Isaf, Llantwit Fardre, Ton-teg, Tyn-y-Nant and Upper Church Village.\nChurch village was served by Church Village railway station on the Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway until 1964.\nCostain, under contract from Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council constructed a bypass to reduce traffic congestion on the A473, Pontypridd to Bridgend (Welsh: Penybont) road, from Cross Inn, near Llantrisant, to Tonteg via Efail Isaf. The Church Village bypass, which is built as a single carriageway, with crawler and overtaking lanes around roundabouts opened in September 2010."

The name Cwmaman is Welsh for \"Aman Valley\", with the River Aman flowing through the village). For postal purposes the village comes under Aberdare. The village lies in the valley of several mountains. Within the village, there are two children's playgrounds and playing fields, with an outdoor pool open during the summer. At the top end of the village, there are several reservoirs, accessible via several footpaths along the river.\nCwmaman was a well-known coal-mining village which, at one time boasted several collieries. Until the 19th Century, Cwmaman was virtually uninhabited, with around 40 farm workers living in and around the community by 1841. By the end of the 1840s, the first coal pits were sunk and Cwmaman began to transform into a thriving industrial settlement, in the later years of the 19th Century Cwmaman housed the workers of five surrounding coal mines - the Fforchaman, Fforchneol, Bedwlwyn, Cwmneol, and the Cwmaman collieries. Cwmaman Colliery was also known as Shepherd\u2019s pit, in honour of its founder Thomas Shepherd, a name it shares with the village\u2019s first public house, the Shepherd\u2019s Arms, opened in 1850.\nThere is an array of parallel roads in the east part of the village.

The chapel now has almost 200 regular attenders in the Welsh language congregation, the English language congregation numbering around 20. Over recent years, the chapel has become a focal point for a significant amount of fund raising for charities. In 2008, the members of the chapel decided to renovate the old vestry to turn it into a community facility that all could use. The project was completed in summer 2010, at a cost of around \u00a3450,000.\n\n"

Llanharan thrived during the British industrial revolution, with several tin and coal mines in the location providing employment to the town's residents. With the decline of heavy industry in the South Wales Coalfield, Llanharan has been in economic decline, though its proximity to the M4 motorway offers its residents easy commutable access to most of South Wales.\nThe most recognisable features of Llanharan are its historic town square, Llanharan House and Church of St Julius and Aaron."

It is situated around 1,100 ft above sea level and is a district of Tylorstown. Until the late 16th century, Penrhys was one of the holiest sites for Christian pilgrims in Wales.\nThe site of Penrhys has a rich religious history dating back to mediaeval times, though few settlements other than farmsteads can be traced to the area. Penrhys is significant for a mediaeval monastery, the holy shrine of \"Our Lady\" built at the holy spring of Ffynnon Fair. During the early 16th century the antiquarian John Leland wrote during his visit to the area that he saw \"Penrise Village, where the Pilgrimage was\", suggesting that a settlement had built up in the area. In 1538 the shrine was destroyed during the English Reformation, and the area appeared to fall into decline. With the arrival of industrialisation in the Rhondda Valley during the 19th century interest in the religious history of Penrhys increased. An archaeological dig at the old chapel was carried out in 1912 and a new statue of the Virgin Mary was unveiled in 1953. In February 1927 the first burial took place at Penrhys cemetery."

It lies on the east side of the River Taff opposite Abercanaid, South of Merthyr and North of Troedyrhiw. To the east of the village lies the Mynydd Cilfach-yr-Encil which rises up to 445 m. Pentrebach can be translated as \"Little Village\"\nPentrebach is part of the Plymouth electoral ward which covers Pentrebach, Abercanaid and Troedyrhiw. The village was founded at the time that John Guest built the Plymouth Ironworks in 1763. The name Guest became part of the Guest, Keen and Nettelfold company (GKN). In 1818 Anthony Hill took over ownership of the business. His House was later used as an old people's home, and today has been converted into a Brewers Fayre Restaurant with a Premier Inn attached.\n\nThe original Merthyr Tramroad, built in 1802, ran alongside the site of the modern day village, on it way from Pennydarren to Abercynon, though very little of the village had been built at that time. A tunnel still exists, which can be visited on the Merthyr Road. Locomotives had to tip their chimneys while going though this tunnel due to the tunnel clearance.\nPentrebach has its own railway station. This opened in 1886 on the standard gauge Taff Vale Railway which runs from Cardiff to Merthyr alongside the River Taff. The original purpose of the railway was to carry iron ore to Cardiff Docks.\nIn 1862, on the south side of the Village, The South Duffryn Colliery was opened with two shafts which were 250 m deep. At the height of the production there were some 1300 men employed there. An opencast mine was also located on the mountainside above the village.\nThe Plymouth Ironworks closed in 1882 and the South Duffryn Colliery ceased production in 1940.\n\nAfter the war, new industries were attracted to the village. In 1945, the Kayser Bondor Factory opened making underwear, followed in 1948 by the establishment of the Hoover factory manufacturing washing machines. The factory later went on the produce the Sinclair C5 battery-powered three-wheeler car. On Friday, 6 March 2009, Hoover confirmed that it was to cease production of washing machines and other laundry products at the factory. Linde has set up a factory in the village on a site where the South Duffryn Colliery was located.\nPentrebach has two clubs: The Hills Plymouth Cricket Club, and the Pentrebach Working men's club. Pentrebach also has a chapel, Jerusalem Chapel, Greenfield School and an Integrated Children's Centre.\nThe mountain above Pentrebach has become popular with hang glider pilots in recent years."

The site of the original village is accessible from the Taff Trail National cycle route 8. This leads down a heavily tree lined slope to the area that was the original village site.\nThe bridge over the River Taff at Pontygwait is a Grade II listed structure. and was featured in the Beauty and the Beast episode of the BBC's Merlin, where a girl has a picnic with a troll beneath the bridge.\nPontygwaith today lacks many dwellings, but one notable exception is Pontygwaith Farm, located on the hill near the bridge, which offers tea room facilities. The gardens have occasionally been opened, for charity days, by the owners.\nThe National Cycle Route 477 Taith Trevithick Trail heads up the east side of the valley from Pontygwaith to Trevithick's Tunnel - just south of Merthyr Tydfil, old stone sleepers can still be seen all around these trails on the east side of the valley where the famous tramroad ran. Cycle route 8 (the Taff Trail) also passes through the village. [1]\nPontygwaith was the birthplace of composer Mansel Thomas OBE (1909 \u2013 1986)."

The valley is made up of two valleys, the larger Rhondda Fawr valley (mawr large) and the smaller Rhondda Fach valley (bach small). Both the singular term 'Rhondda Valley' and the plural 'Rhondda Valleys' are commonly used. In 2001 the Rhondda constituency of the National Assembly for Wales had a population of 72,443; while the National Office of Statistics described the Rhondda urban area as having a population of 59,602. Rhondda is part of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough and is part of the South Wales Valleys.\nThe Rhondda Valley is most notable for its historical link to the coal mining industry which was at its peak between 1840-1925 AD. The Rhondda Valleys were home to a strong early Nonconformist Christian movement which manifested itself in the Baptist chapels which moulded Rhondda values in the 19th and early 20th century. Rhondda is also famous for strong masculine cultural ties within a social community which expressed itself outside industry in the form of male voice choirs, sport and politics."

It is on the eastern bank of the River Taff close to the A470, and historically was in the parish of Eglwysilan.\nRhydyfelin grew from a rural hamlet to a thriving village in the 19th century, due to its location on the Glamorganshire Canal which took iron from Merthyr Tydfil to the city of Cardiff, and linking to this Dr. Richard Griffiths' canal and tramway which took coal from the Rhondda Valleys. Also of note was the nearby Iron and Tin works at Treforest. Other minor works included an ironworks on the site of the tram shed buildings.\nNeighbouring villages are Hawthorn, Treforest and Glyntaff. The village is split into two electoral wards: the lower largely historic part of the village is in Hawthorn ward along with the settlement of Upper Boat which comprises some of the nearby Treforest Estate, while the largely modern housing estates of upper Rhydyfelin are in the ward of Rhydyfelen Central and Ilan. Rhydyfelin is also known as Rhydfelen, which means Yellow ford in the Welsh language.\nRhydyfelin was once served by two railway stations- one on the Cardiff Railway, and one on the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway. After the Grouping, the former Cardiff Railway halt became Rhydyfelin Low Level Halt and the halt of the Pontypridd, Caerphilly and Newport Railway became Rhydyfelin High Level Halt. The halts closed in 1931 and 1953 respectively."

Treforest is now known for its association with the University of South Wales, originally established as The School of Mines at Treforest in 1913.\nTreforest Industrial Estate is not part of Treforest or its electoral ward, most of which is not even within Pontypridd.

It is situated in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, roughly 20 miles (32 km) north-north-west of Cardiff, 4 miles (6 km) north of Pontypridd and 10 miles (16 km) south of Merthyr Tydfil, and forms part of the community of Ynysybwl and Coed-y-cwm.\nCwm Clydach is flanked by the Rhondda and Cynon Valleys. The market town of Pontypridd lies to the south at the meeting point of the three valleys; and to the north lies the large Llanwynno forestry. Before the local government reforms of 1996 Ynysybwl was in the Cynon Valley district of Morgannwg Ganol, and the area is historically a part of Glamorgan (Morgannwg)."
