A number of coal mining communities grew up in the parish, and in the 19th century these became separate local government units.\nOn 19 June 1874, Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Tredegar local boards of health and local government districts were formed, each including parts of the civil parish. The remainder of Bedwellty itself became a local government district on 29 June 1891. In 1894 the local boards were replaced by urban districts. The areas included in Bedwellty, Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Tredegar urban districts became separate civil parishes.\nBedwellty urban district included the hamlets and villages of Aberbargoed, Argoed, Bargoed, Blackwood, New Tredegar, Pengam and Rock.\nIn 1926 Bedwellty and Mynyddislwyn urban districts formed the West Monmouthshire Omnibus Board to ensure local control of bus services. In 1935 a County Review Order altered the boundaries between Bedwellty and Mynyddislwyn.\nThe urban district was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974. Its area was split: the wards of Aberbargoed, Cwmsyfiog, New Tredegar and Phillipstown passed to the Rhymney Valley district of Mid Glamorgan, and the remainder was included in the Islwyn borough of Gwent.\nFurther local government reorganisation in 1996 has led to the area of the former urban district being included in the county borough of Caerphilly. It now corresponds to the communities of Aberbargoed, Argoed, Bargoed, Blackwood, Cefn Fforest, New Tredegar, and part of the community of Darran Valley.\nThe parliamentary constituency of Bedwellty was created in 1918 covering a much larger area. It continued to exist until 1983, when it was replaced by the constituency of Islwyn. The member of parliament for the Bedwellty and Islwyn constituencies from 1970 to 1995 was Neil Kinnock, who took the title Baron Kinnock, of Bedwellty in the County of Gwent in 2005.\n\n"

The Three Sisters Recreation Area is also the site of the Three Sisters Race Circuit, which provides race driving instruction and plays host to kart racing events and motorcycle road race meetings at clubman level.\nThe former Bryn (or Brynne) Hall was the seat of the Gerard family beginning in the thirteenth century or earlier. It was a \"safe house\" for the English Roman Catholic martyr and saint Edmund Arrowsmith and his hand was reportedly preserved there after his execution. The house, dating to the fourteenth century, has now completely collapsed and remaining stones been cleared.\nThe Unitarian Park Lane Chapel in Wigan Road was built in 1697, though its congregation was founded in 1662. It is the oldest Non-conformist chapel and congregation in the whole district. By the nineteenth century Park Lane was only one of nine non-conformist chapels in the heavily recusant area."

It is part of the district of Caerphilly within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire. Located north of Wattsville and about 5 miles north of the nearest town Risca and south of Blackwood.\nCwmfelinfach was home to a coal mining community during the early to mid 20th century. The colliery, known as \"Nine Mile Point\", opened about 1905 and closed in 1964. Nine Mile Point Colliery was the site of the first ever 'sit in' of miners. During 1935 there was a \"stay down strike\" involving 164 colliers. They were protesting over the use of \"Scab\" miners (men not members of the Federation unlike the rest of the \"Points\" workforce) and their ordeal only ended after the company promised no non-federation men would be employed at the colliery, the stay-down strike lasted for 177 hours. Miners from other collieries in the area, some taking similar action, supported their action.\nCwmfelinfach can be translated from the Welsh language as \"valley of the little mill\". The village was a small hamlet (place) until the late 19th century \u2014 therefore the majority of housing is traditional terraced from early 20th century. A map of 1885 showns the Melin (mill) and the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist chapel Babel Chapel. [1] The grave of Islwyn the 19th century Welsh-language poet can be found here. [2]\nTo the east the valley is bordered by the hills of Pen-y-Trwyn (1,028 ft \/ 313 m). To the west is Mynydd y Grug (1,132 ft \/ 345 m)."

In 1894 the Crosskeys area was included in the urban district of Risca, and Abercarn was constituted a separate urban district.\nThe remainder of the parish was included in St Mellons Rural District, and included the hamlets of Fleur-de-Lis, Gelligroes, Penmain, Pontllanfraith and Ynysddu.\nOn October 1, 1903 Mynyddislwyn became an urban district. In 1926 it formed the West Monmouthshire Omnibus Board with neighbouring Bedwellty urban district, to maintain local ownership of local bus services. In 1935 the boundaries were adjusted with Bedwas and Machen and Bedwellty urban districts under a County Review Order.\nMynyddislwyn urban district was abolished in 1974, with its area passing to the borough of Islwyn, in the newly created administrative county of Gwent. Further local government reform in 1996 included the area in the county borough of Caerphilly.\nUnfortunately, St Tudor's church rarely has services now due to the poor attendance and commitment of the minute congregation.\n\n"

It is the principal settlement of the civil parish of Dartmoor Forest.\nThe village has its origins in 1785, when Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, Secretary to the Prince of Wales, leased a large area of moorland from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, hoping to convert it into good farmland. He encouraged people to live in the area and suggested that a prison be built there. He called the settlement Princetown after the Prince of Wales.\nPrincetown is the site of Dartmoor Prison. At around 435 metres (1,430 feet) above sea level, it is the highest settlement on the moor, and one of the highest in the United Kingdom. It is also the largest settlement located on the high moor. The Princetown Railway, closed in 1956, was also the highest railway line in England, its Princetown terminus being 435 metres (1,427 ft) above sea level."

It is today part of the Newport conurbation (which as a whole has a population of 140,200), though it is not a Ward of Newport City Council. Risca has a railway station, opened on the Ebbw Valley Railway in February 2008, after a gap of 46 years.\nThe town lies at the south-eastern edge of the South Wales Coalfield and a coal mine used to operate in the town with terraced housing nearby for miners. On 1 December 1860 an explosion at the Black Vein Colliery at Risca killed more than 140 men and boys as well as 28 pit ponies.\nRisca is home to Ty-Sign, which is a large housing estate built in the early 1960s as a satellite village for the then new Llanwern steelworks. Risca has a rural aspect and is surrounded to the east and west by several extensively wooded hills [2] including Mynydd Machen [3] (1,188 ft\/362m) and Twmbarlwm [4] (1,375 ft\/419m) which attract tourists for the hillwalking and mountain bikers to Cwmcarn Forest Drive."
