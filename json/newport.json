The name means \"The slope (allt) of the ash trees (ynn which is the plural of onnen - ash tree)\" in Welsh.\nAllt-yr-yn forms an electoral ward (district) and coterminous community parish of the city. It is mainly residential and contains many large houses built in the early part of the 20th century. Some of the district is built upon the Ridgeway, with some of the ward offering views of surrounding areas such as Twmbarlwm. The area is governed by the Newport City Council.\n\nTowards the City Centre, Allt-yr-yn is home to the offices of Newport City Council, at the Civic Centre, of which its clock tower can be seen for miles around.\nUniversity of Wales, Newport had a campus located in Allt-yr-yn. It served as the university's Science, IT and Business faculty. before moving to a site with a new \u00a335 million complex on the banks of the River Usk in central Newport. The new campus formally opened in January 2011. Initially the new campus will house the Newport Business School and design, film and media elements of the Newport School of Art, Media and Design.\nOn the west side of Allt-yr-yn heights there is a Local Nature Reserve containing ancient woodland, meadows and five ponds. Between 1934 and the mid-1960s this was home to an open-air swimming baths, and is now managed by a volunteer group known as WING - Wildlife in Newport Group. The nature reserve borders the Crumlin Arm of the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal which runs parallel to the M4 Motorway at Allt-yr-yn. Lock 2 has been restored by volunteers and work has started on lock 3. Lock 1 disappeared under road works in Newport early in the 20th century.\nA permanent military presence was established in the area with the completion of the Cavalry Barracks in 1845.\nThere was once a hospital in the ward, but this was deemed surplus to requirements and the site is now the Allt-yr-yn Heights estate."

It lies one third of the way down the South Island's east coast, just north of Banks Peninsula, which itself, since 2006, lies within the formal limits of Christchurch. The population of Christchurch City at the 5 March 2013 census was 341,469.\nThe city was named by the Canterbury Association, which settled the surrounding province of Canterbury. The name of Christchurch was agreed on at the first meeting of the association on 27 March 1848. It was suggested by John Robert Godley, who had attended Christ Church, Oxford. Some early writers called the town Christ Church, but it was recorded as Christchurch in the minutes of the management committee of the association. Christchurch became a city by Royal Charter on 31 July 1856, making it officially the oldest established city in New Zealand.\nThe river that flows through the centre of the city (its banks now largely forming an urban park) was named Avon at the request of the pioneering Deans brothers to commemorate the Scottish Avon, which rises in the Ayrshire hills near what was their grandfathers' farm and flows into the Clyde.\nThe usual M\u0101ori name for Christchurch is \u014ctautahi (\"the place of Tautahi\"). This was originally the name of a specific site by the Avon River near present-day Kilmore Street and the Christchurch Central Fire Station. The site was a seasonal dwelling of Ng\u0101i Tahu chief Te Potiki Tautahi, whose main home was Port Levy on Banks Peninsula. The \u014ctautahi name was adopted in the 1930s. Prior to that the Ng\u0101i Tahu generally referred to the Christchurch area as Karaitiana, a transliteration of the English word Christian. The city's name is often abbreviated by New Zealanders to Chch. In New Zealand Sign Language, the city's name is the fingerspelled letter C (made by forming the hand into a C shape) signed twice, with the second to the right of the first, while mouthing \"Christchurch\"."

The northern boundary is formed from Gwern-y-cleppa to junction 28 of the M4, then the A48 Cardiff Road. The eastern boundary is formed from the Ebbw River Bridge roundabout to the west of the International Rectifier plant, Duffryn Drive, along the southern edge of Tredegar House country park, Pencarn Lane and Percoed Lane.\nDespite being a mostly rural parish to the south and west, the north and east is a continuation of the Duffryn built-up area, and has seen large increases in population in recent years due to the continued suburbanisation of Newport. This built-up area of Coedkernew forms a crescent around Duffryn and as such, much newly built housing in the Duffryn area actually falls within Coedkernew.\nThis area contains the landmark Coedkernew footbridge over the A48, the giant LG plant, three business parks or industrial parks: Imperial Park, Celtic Springs and Cleppa Park, the Patent Office, Office for National Statistics, Tredegar House as well as the large Celtic Horizons estate and St. Josephs RC High School.\nAt the northern boundary near Gwern-y-cleppa, the remains of a pre-historic burial chamber can be found which is believed to be neolithic. It is also considered to be one of the possible sites for Celliwig, the earliest recorded localisation for King Arthur's court.\n^ Office for National Statistics Parish Headcounts: Coedkernew\n^ Coedkernew Footbridge:: OS grid ST2784 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square!\n^ Imperial Park, Newport:: OS grid ST2884 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square!\n^ Celtic Springs Business Park, Newport:: OS grid ST2784 :: Geograph Britain and Ireland - photograph every grid square!\n^ GWERN-Y-CLEPPA, LONG BARROW | Site Details | Coflein"

It is bisected by the elevated section of the A4042 road. The district is well-served in transport terms as it contains junction 26 and 25a of the M4 as well as the A4042 and A4051 roads. There is a regular Newport Transport bus service from Malpas and Bettws to the city centre.\nTo the eastern side, adjoining the river is Shaftesbury Park, which was the original home of Newport Rugby Club before they moved to the Newport Athletics and Cricket Club site at Rodney Parade.\nA cycle and pedestrian walkway alongside the River Usk links Newport city centre at Crindau to the Home Farm area of Caerleon, 1 mile from central Caerleon. It is planned to extend the walkway from Home Farm to the centre of Caerleon. There is a marked heritage trail in Caerleon.\nCrindau is well served by a number of churches providing a cross-section of Christian traditions including Malpas Road Evangelical Church, Crindau Christian Fellowship, Shaftesbury Methodist Church and All Saints Church."

Built on land belonging to Tredegar House [2], it was completed in 1978 and at the time won several awards for its design. The layout of the estate, as viewed from above, is that of large terraces undulating around a central wooded area. Originally a Council Estate, Duffryn is now a mix of private ownership and Newport City Homes RSL (Registered Social Landlord) properties.\nThe design of the estate is the result of a council competition. It was won by a consortium committed to the theories of planning devised in the architecture department of Cambridge University in the 1960s. The District Amenities Centre that was planned for the south-west corner of the 96-acre site was never built, so the plan of a largely self-sufficient community was not realised.\nDespite the relative recent development of the estate, the name Duffryn is an ancient name for the area. Duffryn is an anglicised version of the Welsh Dyffryn (meaning large U-shaped valley).\nDuffryn is home to two of Newport's largest secondary schools \u2014 Duffryn High School [3] and St. Joseph's RC High School. In 2006, Duffryn High School was the filming location of the Doctor Who episode \"School Reunion\", filmed in late-summer 2005.\nThe majority of the estate is heated from an updated central boiler house."

For most of its 35-mile (56 km) length it runs through the Brecon Beacons National Park, and its present rural character and tranquillity belies its original purpose as an industrial corridor for coal and iron, which were brought to the canal by a network of tramways and\/or railroads, many of which were built and owned by the canal company.\nThe \"Mon and Brec\" was originally two independent canals - the Monmouthshire Canal from Newport to Pontymoile Basin (including the Crumlin Arm) and the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal running from Pontymoile to Brecon. Both canals were abandoned in 1962, but the Brecknock and Abergavenny route and a small section of the Monmouthshire route have been reopened since 1970. Much of the rest of the original Monmouthshire Canal is the subject of a restoration plan, which includes the construction of a new marina at the Newport end of the canal."

                        "_text": "Somerton \/\u02c8s\u028cm\u0259rt\u0259n\/ is a small town and civil parish in the South Somerset district of the English county of Somerset. It gave its name to the county of Somerset, was briefly, around the start of the 14th century, the county town, and around 900 AD was possibly the capital of Wessex. It has held a weekly market since the Middle Ages, and the main square with its market cross is today an attractive location for visitors. Situated on the River Cary, approximately 8.8 miles (14.2 km) north-west of Yeovil, the town has its own parish council serving a population of 4,697 as of 2011. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Etsome and Hurcot.\nThe history of Somerton dates back to the Anglo-Saxon era, when it was an important political and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined despite being the former county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century. Despite losing county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later rail transport via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining.\nIn the centre of Somerton the wide market square, with its octagonal roofed market cross, is surrounded by old houses, while close by is the 13th century Church of St Michael and All Angels. Somerton also had links with Muchelney Abbey in the Middle Ages. The BBC drama The Monocled Mutineer was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986."
