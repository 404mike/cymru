Barry's stretch of coast, on the Bristol Channel, has the world's second highest tidal range of 15 metres (49 ft), second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.\n\nThe peninsula was an island until the 1880s when it was linked to the mainland as the town of Barry expanded. This was partly due to the opening of Barry Docks by the Barry Railway Company. Established by David Davies, the docks now link up the gap which used to form Barry Island.\nAlthough Barry Island used to be home to a Butlins Holiday Camp, it is now known more for its beach and Barry Island Pleasure Park.\n\n"

The area was mainly farmland until its ample quantities of high quality clay and workable seams of steam coal led to the construction of a brickworks and the sinking of the Bryncethin Colliery by The Barrow-in Furness Iron and Coal Company. This led to an increase in the population of the village and to the construction of housing for the workforce. Both industries are now long gone and much effort is being made to provide recreational facilities on the site of the former colliery and clay pits.

The area is one of the most affluent parts of the county borough, with 29% and 35% of households in the Bryncoch North and Bryncoch South respectively earning more than \u00a340,000 per year.\nHistorically the village of Bryncoch was centred on Main Road and a few adjacent streets, but the village expanded considerably in the 1960s with the building of the Furzeland Drive and Elias Drive developments. This area makes up the council ward of Bryncoch North, which has only one small street of social housing at Heol Pant Glas, named after a nearby farm located at the furthest northern corner of the ward. The council ward of Bryncoch South includes the distinct areas of the Rhyddings, Gilfach, Penywern, Leiros Parc, and the large social housing estate of Caewern.\nThere are two village primary schools: Blaenhonddan and the Bryncoch Church in Wales school. There is also a special school, Ysgol Hendre. The nearest secondary school is Dwr Y Felin Comprehensive.

The city is the country's chief commercial centre, the base for most national cultural and sporting institutions, the Welsh national media, and the seat of the National Assembly for Wales. The unitary authority area's mid-2011 population was estimated to be 346,100, while the population of the Larger Urban Zone was estimated at 861,400 in 2009. Cardiff is part of the Cardiff and south Wales valleys metropolitan area of about 1,100,000 people. Cardiff is a significant tourist centre and the most popular visitor destination in Wales with 18.3 million visitors in 2010. In 2011, Cardiff was ranked sixth in the world in National Geographic's alternative tourist destinations.\nThe city of Cardiff is the county town of the historic county of Glamorgan (and later South Glamorgan). Cardiff is part of the Eurocities network of the largest European cities. The Cardiff Urban Area covers a slightly larger area outside the county boundary, and includes the towns of Dinas Powys and Penarth. A small town until the early 19th century, its prominence as a major port for the transport of coal following the arrival of industry in the region contributed to its rise as a major city.\nCardiff was made a city in 1905, and proclaimed the capital of Wales in 1955. Since the 1990s, Cardiff has seen significant development. A new waterfront area at Cardiff Bay contains the Senedd building, home to the Welsh Assembly and the Wales Millennium Centre arts complex. Current developments include the continuation of the redevelopment of the Cardiff Bay and city centre areas with projects such as the Cardiff International Sports Village, a BBC drama village, and a new business district in the city centre.\nSporting venues in the city include the Millennium Stadium (the national stadium for the Wales national rugby union team), SWALEC Stadium (the home of Glamorgan County Cricket Club), Cardiff City Stadium (the home of Cardiff City football team), Cardiff International Sports Stadium (the home of Cardiff Amateur Athletic Club) and Cardiff Arms Park (the home of Cardiff Blues and Cardiff RFC rugby union teams). The city was awarded with the European City of Sport in 2009 due to its role in hosting major international sporting events. Again Cardiff was the European City of Sport in 2014. The Millennium Stadium hosted 11 football matches as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics, including the games' opening event and the men's bronze medal match."

Cefn Cribwr, as a community, recorded a population of 1,546 in the 2001 Census, reducing to 1,481 at the 2011 Census.\nThe community centre (opened 1924), locally known as the 'Green Hall' was originally conceived as a Miners' Welfare Hall and was supported by colliery owners and colliers. Many political meetings were held there. Labour politician and former Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald spoke there in the closing weeks of the General Strike of 1926. The Wesley Dramatic Society entertained, as did the members of Siloam Chapel who performed many dramas and concerts. The community centre today, is mainly used as the venue for the meetings of Cefn Cribwr Labour Party.\nBedford Park, found in Cefn Cribwr is now an area of 40 acres (160,000 m2) of ancient woodland and meadows, glades and open spaces. It was once an area of intense industrial activity following the building of a blast furnace here in 1780 by the Birmingham Industrialist John Bedford. He also sank pits to mine the raw materials of ironstone and coal as well as founding a forge and brickworks. The ironworks were never as successful as Bedford had hoped and began to decline after his death in 1791. Coal mining and brick making, however, continued throughout the 19th Century and industrial activity at Bedford Park ceased after World War I.\nCefn Cribwr Ironworks in Bedford Park is now protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is one of the most complete of its kind in Britain. Many parts of the ironworks and related buildings can still be seen.\nThe community has several public footpaths and cycling routes which pass through the park following the line of the old Dyffryn, Llynfi and Porthcawl railway which linked the ironworks to the coast.\n^ National Statistics, Census 2001\n^ \"Ward population 2011\".

The concentration of development greatly facilitates interaction between people and businesses, benefiting both parties in the process, but it also presents challenges to managing urban growth. A big city or metropolis usually has associated suburbs and exurbs. Such cities are usually associated with metropolitan areas and urban areas, creating numerous business commuters traveling to urban centers for employment. Once a city expands far enough to reach another city, this region can be deemed a conurbation or megalopolis.

Gall cyw'r gog daflu'r cywion eraill o'r nyth, i sicrhau ei fod ef yn cael yr holl fwyd.\nMae'n aderyn cymharol fawr, llwyd o ran lliw, a gall edrych yn debyg iawn i aderyn ysglyfaethus o gael cipolwg arno'n hedfan. Daw'r enw \"cwcw\" o alwad yr aderyn.\nEr fod y gog yn parhau yn aderyn cymharol gyffredin yng Nghymru, mae ei niferoedd wedi gostwng dros yr ugain mlynedd diwethaf. Mae'n cyrraedd o Affrica tua chanol Ebrill fel rheol, ac mae clywed y gog yn cael ei ystyried yn arwydd o wanwyn. Caiff Clychau'r Gog eu henw oherwydd eu bod yn blodeuo yn yr un cyfnod."

The current church of St. Crallo was built in the 13th century.\nAccording to a local legend, after his death in battle near Ogmore Castle, King Arthur was interred in a cave in Coed-y-Mwstwr Forest, just behind the village of Coychurch, secretly for fear that the news of his death might split the nation. When his son came of age to replace him at the throne, Arthur's death was announced, and his body moved to a grave at Cor Emrys church close to Pencoed.\nThe crematorium, built in 1970, was the last design of modernist architect Maxwell Fry."

Until the late 19th century most fountains operated by gravity, and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a reservoir or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air.\nIn addition to providing drinking water, fountains were used for decoration and to celebrate their builders. Roman fountains were decorated with bronze or stone masks of animals or heroes. In the Middle Ages, Moorish and Muslim garden designers used fountains to create miniature versions of the gardens of paradise. King Louis XIV of France used fountains in the Gardens of Versailles to illustrate his power over nature. The baroque decorative fountains of Rome in the 17th and 18th centuries marked the arrival point of restored Roman aqueducts and glorified the Popes who built them.\nBy the end of the 19th century, as indoor plumbing became the main source of drinking water, urban fountains became purely decorative. Mechanical pumps replaced gravity and allowed fountains to recycle water and to force it high into the air. The Jet d'Eau in Lake Geneva, built in 1951, shoots water 140 metres (460 ft) in the air. The highest such fountain in the world is King Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which spouts water 260 metres (850 ft) above the Red Sea.\nFountains are used today to decorate city parks and squares; to honor individuals or events; for recreation and for entertainment. A Splash pad or spray pool allows city residents to enter, get wet and cool off in summer. The musical fountain combines moving jets of water, colored lights and recorded music, controlled by a computer, for dramatic effects. Drinking fountains provide clean drinking water in public buildings, parks and public spaces."

It is one of four towns in the Vale of Glamorgan and the third largest by population (13,366 (2001)) after Barry and Penarth, and ahead of Cowbridge, which lies about 4.5 miles (7.2 km) to the northeast. The town centre of Llantwit Major lies about 9 miles (14 km) southeast of the centre of Bridgend, 10 miles (16 km) west of the centre of Barry, and about 15 miles (24 km) miles south-west of the centre of the Welsh capital of Cardiff which lies further to the east beyond Barry.\nThe town's name in Welsh, Llanilltud Fawr, is derived from the name of Saint Illtud, who came to the area from Brittany, Gaul. He founded the monastery of Illtud and the college attached to it, Cor Tewdws, which would grow into one of the most esteemed Christian colleges of the times. At peak it attracted over 2000 students, including princes and numerous eminent clergymen, some now revered as saints. Destroyed by the Vikings in 987, the monastery was rebuilt in 1111 and continued to be a centre of learning governed by Tewkesbury Abbey until it closed in 1539 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The 13th-century St Illtyd's Church, built near the ancient monastery, today is a Grade I listed building and one of the oldest parish churches in Wales.\nThe modern town of Llantwit developed rapidly in the 20th century to accommodate Royal Air Force personnel from the base built at nearby St Athan, but it retains its medieval cobbled streets and buildings of the 15th and 16th centuries. Llantwit Major railway station on the Vale of Glamorgan Line was reopened in June 2005. Collugh Beach is a popular surfing venue and has the remnants of an Iron Age fort and some of the finest examples of Jurassic-period fossils in Wales. The pebble beach and its dramatic clifftops are part of a 14 miles (23 km)-long coastline protected under the Glamorgan Heritage Coast, which stretches from Gileston in the east to Newton Point beyond Southerndown in the west."

Maesteg lies at the northernmost end of the Llynfi Valley, close to the border with Neath Port Talbot. In 2011, Maesteg had a population of 20,612.\nHistorically a part of Glamorgan, the growth of the town started with the opening of ironworks in the 1820s and 1830s. Once a coal mining area, the last pit closed in 1985. With the decline of the coal industry and, more recently, the closure of one large factory producing cosmetics and another manufacturing vehicle components, the valley has become a residential\/dormitory area for the Port Talbot, Bridgend and Cardiff journey to work areas. 11% (1,867 out of 20,702) of the town's population speak Welsh.\n^ Census 2011, Bridgend B.C.

The walk goes past the Horse Shoe Inn at Marcross. Refreshments are sold at the Nash Point car park and there are toilets in the small building when it is open.\nIn 1962, the empty tanker BP Driver was pushed on the rocks and was abandoned.

There are regular buses to Porthcawl, Bridgend and Port Talbot. The nearest railway station is Pyle.\nNorth Cornelly is first recorded as 'The Vill of Walter Lupellus' in a 12th-century document. The name North Cornelly probably derived from its close proximity to the crossroads where the road to the original village of Cornelly (present-day South Cornelly) branched off from the main road."

Penarth is the wealthiest seaside resort in the Cardiff Urban Area, and the second largest town in the Vale of Glamorgan, next only to the administrative centre of Barry.\nDuring the Victorian era Penarth was a highly popular holiday destination, promoted nationally as \"The Garden by the Sea\" and was packed by visitors from the Midlands and the West Country as well as day trippers from the South Wales valleys, mostly arriving by train. Today the town, with its traditional seafront, continues to be a regular summer holiday destination (predominantly for older visitors), but their numbers are much lower than was common from Victorian times until the 1960s, when cheap overseas package holidays were introduced.\nAlthough the number of holiday visitors has greatly declined, the town retains a substantial retired population, representing over 25% of residents, but Penarth is now predominantly a dormitory town for Cardiff commuters. The town\u2019s population was recorded as 20,396 in the United Kingdom Census 2001.\nThe town retains extensive surviving Victorian and Edwardian architecture in many traditional parts of the town, and house prices are usually significantly higher than similar properties in nearby Cardiff."

Recent signage and postoffice records have now been changed to the correct spelling. At one side of the village, marking its boundary with Pantygog, the River Garw is joined by the Nant Forch Wen. At the other side, towards its boundary with Blaengarw, the River Garw is joined by the Nant Gelli Wern (marsh grove stream) at Ffaldau, the village square.\nAmong those born in the village are the artist and journalist Molly Parkin (Molly Thomas), snooker player Ryan Day, Wales rugby captain John Lloyd, and news reader Huw Edwards.\nNumerous locations in Pontycymer feature as the fictional village of Ogw in the film Very Annie Mary.

It is mostly known for its beach (officially named Dunraven bay), which is a popular tourist destination during the summer months and since 1972 has been designated a Heritage Coast and is part of the Southerndown Coast SSSI. When the tide is out there is an expanse of sand and pools. The cliffs are an obvious example of sedimentary rock.\nAs Southerndown, along with nearby Ogmore-by-Sea, is a west-facing beach (and hence on the Atlantic coast), off-shore winds from the East generate much good-quality surf, helped by the warming effects of the Gulf Stream.\nThere are actually two beaches separated by a headland. On the headland are the remains of Dunraven Castle.\nThe second beach is only accessible by steep steps and is largely unused. The steps also reach the beach fairly far out from the cliffside, so it's easy to become cut off from them and stranded on the beach at high tide. The second beach is one of the largest in Glamorgan and stretches all the way down the coast to Nash Point near Llantwit Major.\nIt has been used in the occasional TV production, including on Doctor Who: as Bad Wolf Bay in \"Doomsday\" and \"Journey's End\" and as the surface of the alien planet in \"The Time of Angels\" and \"Flesh and Stone\" and as the engine room of the ark ship in \"Dinosaurs on a Spaceship\". It also appeared in Merlin in the first season episode 'The Labyrinth of Gedref'. It was also featured in the Bob Dylan film Hearts of Fire, with Dylan looking out over the second beach down onto Rupert Everett.\nDuring the summer, Southerndown Lifesaving Club use the beach as opposed to St Donat's Castle. It has a notable golf club, Southerndown Golf Club."

In this usage it was common for many 19th-century cheap, cast articles such as candlesticks and clock cases and early 20th-century Art Nouveau ornaments and Art Deco figures.\nEarly twentieth-century Art Nouveau and Art Deco figures and lamps were often made of spelter. The metal has been used since about the 1860s to make statues, tablewares, and lamps that resemble bronze. Spelter is soft and breaks easily. To test for spelter, scratch the base of the piece. Bronze is solid; spelter will show a silvery scratch.\nThe word \"pewter\" is thought to be derived from the word \"spelter\". Zinc ingots formed by smelting might also be termed spelter."
