It is currently in the south of Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, but until 1974 was part of Gelligaer Urban District Council in the county of Glamorgan.\nIt has a population of around 1,400 people. The combined population of Bedlinog and Trelewis has been recently recorded as approximately 3,140. Previously, it was surrounded by coal mines and nearly all jobs were related directly to this industry, but all the mines are now closed. Unemployment is high but the increasing prosperity and growth of Cardiff, only half an hour south by car, has created many commuter jobs and a feeling of optimism for the future.\nThe village is sometimes seen as being isolated, but it is only a 30-minute drive from Cardiff, 45 minutes from Swansea and 45 minutes from Newport. The village is surrounded by steep, rolling green hills, from the top of which the Severn Estuary and the coast of Devon can be clearly seen.\nIn the past, Bedlinog was also nicknamed \"Little Moscow\" owing to the relatively high concentration of communists in the village. During the 1930s communists from the village volunteered to travel to Spain to fight in the Spanish Civil War. The Welsh socialist ethic still remains in the village, as well as in neighbouring Trelewis from where similar communist volunteers fought in the same civil war."

Immediately to the north of the village is the hill of Cefn Cil Sanws on the southern slopes of which is Merthyr Tydfil Golf Club. The village is bounded both to the north and the west by the Brecon Beacons National Park.\nNotable features of the village are the A465 Heads of the Valleys Road and the impressive curving Cefn Coed Viaduct (51.7593\u00b0N 3.4064\u00b0W\ufeff \/ 51.7593; -3.4064\ufeff (Cefn Coed Viaduct)), an 1866 Grade II* listed building which formerly carried the Brecon and Merthyr railway over the River Taff but which now carries the Taff Trail, route 8 of the National Cycleway. It is the third largest viaduct in Wales and was designed by engineers Alexander Sutherland and Henry Conybeare. Sutherland was a friend of Robert Thompson Crawshay of the nearby Cyfarthfa Ironworks, and the viaduct was built on a curve to satisfy conditions laid down by the Crawshay Estate.\nBeyond the last buildings of Cefn, and parallel to the A470 road, lies the Jewish cemetery. It was established by the then-Merthyr Hebrew Congregation and consecrated in the 1860s, one of very few north of Cardiff. It is located on a steep slope with a stone wall and a small chapel (ohel)\n^ Ordnance Survey 1:25,000 scale Explorer map sheet OL12 Brecon Beacons National Park: western area\n^ Merthyr Tydfil Heritage Regeneration Trust.

It consists principally of the Gurnos Estate, a large housing estate established by Merthyr Tydfil Council in the early 1950s and expanded over many years. Many of the initial streets were named after trees; such as Oak, Acacia and Rowan. A major expansion took place during the 1970s, including the building of Prince Charles Hospital. Streets on 1970s development were named after flowers and shrubs; such as Lavender, Heather, Lupin and Forsythia, with the exception of the three most recent areas known as Pen-Gurnos, Pen-y-Dre and Pen-y-Fan View. The area built since the 1970s is still often referred to locally as The New Estate.\nIt was reported in February 2011, that men living on the Gurnos Estate currently have a life expectancy of just 58 years, less than men in Iraq or Haiti This statement was later retracted and rectified, the Mail Online version of the article now states; \"An earlier version of this article referred to the figure for life expectancy in Merthyr Tydfil as being 58.8 years. In fact, this is the figure for \u2018healthy life expectancy\u2019 in Merthyr Tydfil, and the average life expectancy is not lower than that in Iraq or Haiti as originally reported.\".\nThe area was formerly open land, including the long-established Gurnos Farm. It also encompassed the notoriously dangerous Goitre Pond.\nThe design and planning of the Gurnos estate borrows ideas from the Radburn system. The estate has become notorious throughout Wales, with the reputation of being an area of deprivation and crime.\nThe Gurnos Tavern, one of the two community centres and many of the maisonette flats were demolished to make greener areas during the late 1990s."

Once the largest town in Wales, it is now the 14th largest urban area in Wales. It is in the historic county of Glamorgan and is currently the main town in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough administered by Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council. Both the town and the county borough are often referred to as 'Merthyr'.\nAccording to legend, the town is named after Saint Tydfil, a daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog. According to her legend, she was slain at Merthyr by pagans around 480; the place was subsequently named Merthyr Tydfil in her honour. Although merthyr generally means \"martyr\" in modern Welsh, the meaning here is closer to the Latin martyrium: the mausoleum or church built over the relics of a martyr. Similar examples, all from south Wales, include Merthyr Cynog, Merthyr Dyfan and Merthyr Mawr. The Cornish and Breton language equivalents, in place names, are merther and merzher.\n^ Gwyn A.

                        "_text": "Pentrebach (sometimes written Pentre-Bach) (translation: small village) is a village in Merthyr Tydfil County Borough, Wales. It lies on the east side of the River Taff opposite Abercanaid, South of Merthyr and North of Troedyrhiw. To the east of the village lies the Mynydd Cilfach-yr-Encil which rises up to 445 m. Pentrebach can be translated as \"Little Village\"\nPentrebach is part of the Plymouth electoral ward which covers Pentrebach, Abercanaid and Troedyrhiw. The village was founded at the time that John Guest built the Plymouth Ironworks in 1763. The name Guest became part of the Guest, Keen and Nettelfold company (GKN). In 1818 Anthony Hill took over ownership of the business. His House was later used as an old people's home, and today has been converted into a Brewers Fayre Restaurant with a Premier Inn attached.\n\nThe original Merthyr Tramroad, built in 1802, ran alongside the site of the modern day village, on it way from Pennydarren to Abercynon, though very little of the village had been built at that time. A tunnel still exists, which can be visited on the Merthyr Road. Locomotives had to tip their chimneys while going though this tunnel due to the tunnel clearance.\nPentrebach has its own railway station. This opened in 1886 on the standard gauge Taff Vale Railway which runs from Cardiff to Merthyr alongside the River Taff. The original purpose of the railway was to carry iron ore to Cardiff Docks.\nIn 1862, on the south side of the Village, The South Duffryn Colliery was opened with two shafts which were 250 m deep. At the height of the production there were some 1300 men employed there. An opencast mine was also located on the mountainside above the village.\nThe Plymouth Ironworks closed in 1882 and the South Duffryn Colliery ceased production in 1940.\n\nAfter the war, new industries were attracted to the village. In 1945, the Kayser Bondor Factory opened making underwear, followed in 1948 by the establishment of the Hoover factory manufacturing washing machines. The factory later went on the produce the Sinclair C5 battery-powered three-wheeler car. On Friday, 6 March 2009, Hoover confirmed that it was to cease production of washing machines and other laundry products at the factory. Linde has set up a factory in the village on a site where the South Duffryn Colliery was located.\nPentrebach has two clubs: The Hills Plymouth Cricket Club, and the Pentrebach Working men's club. Pentrebach also has a chapel, Jerusalem Chapel, Greenfield School and an Integrated Children's Centre.\nThe mountain above Pentrebach has become popular with hang glider pilots in recent years."
